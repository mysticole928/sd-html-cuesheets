<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P><br><br>Why don't you join up hands, circle to the left go movin' round the ring now<br>
Reverse trail and walk in single file<br>
And now the girls back track and then when you meet her turn thru<br>
Left allemande then weave around that ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Now she's a melody in search of the words I love you</L></FONT><br>
Swing that gal, promenade you know<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She's a light in the night with nowhere to shine<br>
She's a partner that nobody chose</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Why don't those heads go right & left thru, you turn there with your lady<br>
Slide thru, then pass thru, star thru you know<br>
Pass thru, do a wheel & deal, a double pass thru<br>
First 2 left, the next 2 right, go right & left thru<br>
Why don't you slide thru and swing, oh you swing the corner lady<br>
You promenade go round you know<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She's a light in the night with nowhere to shine<br>
She's a partner that nobody chose</L></FONT><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She's tried and she's tried and she's tried to keep on trying<br>
Everything she tried fell apart<br>
She's loved and she's loved and she'd love to keep on loving<br>
But every man she loved broke her heart</L></FONT><br>
Circle left<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">ENDING</P><br><br>Sides star the route<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She's fallen and stumbled and stumbled and fallen<br>
But no one picked her up when she fell<br>
She stood up with hopes up that someone would show up<br>
And some day you never can tell</L></FONT><br>
Circle left<br>
