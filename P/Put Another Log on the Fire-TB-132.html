Go out to the car and change the tyre<BR>
Wash my socks and sew my old blue jeans</SPAN><BR>

The head two couples promenade go halfway<BR>
Two and four do the right and left thru<BR>
Flutterwheel go full around then sweep a quarter more<BR>
Pass thru, do a dosado full around<BR>
Spin chain thru, come on baby<BR>
Girls you circulate one time and swing, promenade<BR>

Then come and tell me why you're leaving me</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Don't I let you wash the car on Sunday<BR>
Don't I warn you when you're getting fat<BR>
Ain't I always nice to your kid sister<BR>
Well a man can't love a woman more than that</SPAN><BR>
