*Down in Louisiana where the bayou flows<br>
Lives a little man called Piroque Joe<br>
He wears a red shirt and a pole cat cap<br>
When he walks his gum boots go flip flop flap</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*He's fast as lightning and quick as a cat<br>
He can out run the best muskrat<br>
He can make a piroque go, go, go<br>
That's why they call him Piroque Joe<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">*He's got a puppet on a string and a trick yo-yo</P><br><br>He puts on a show everywhere he goes<br>
That's why they love little Piroque Joe<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">*Eat boiled shrimp, drink strawberry wine</P><br><br>They all keep time to the fiddler's bow<br>
That's why they love little Piroque Joe</L></FONT><br>
