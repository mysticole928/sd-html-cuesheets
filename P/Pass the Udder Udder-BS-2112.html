     Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt ... Moo!
     <br>
     Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt ... Moo!
     <br>
     <br>
     I been across the nation many times now
     <br>
     East to west, north and south as well
     <br>
     I've been taking all the ribbin', lettin' people do their fibbin'
     <br>
     Here's one thing that I've just got to tell
     <br>
     <br>
     Way down south in ol' Jack County down in Texas
     <br>
     Was born 13 children on a farm
     <br>
     They made doctors, farmers, preachers, superintendents and school teachers
     <br>
     And maybe I'm the one who likes to yarn
     <br>
     <br>
     Pass the udder udder over to my udder brudder
     <br>
     Pass the udder udder this-a-way
     <br>
     So we passed the udder udder and I passed it to my brudder
     <br>
     Lord, we had a handful every day
     <br>
     <br>
     They say things grow big up in Alaska
     <br>
     But there's nothing in that state to quite compare
     <br>
     To a cow that we once had us, the name of her was Gladys
     <br>
     Boy, you should have seen the neighbors stand and stare
     <br>
     <br>
     She stood 10 feet tall and had one purple eyeball
     <br>
     It took eight of us to milk her, here is why:
     <br>
     She had 27 spigots, and the tourists all bought tickets
     <br>
     Just to watch us milk and hear us loudly cry-y-y-y...
     <br>
     <br>
     Pass the udder udder over to my udder brudder
     <br>
     Pass the udder udder this-a-way
     <br>
     So we passed the udder udder and I passed it to my brudder
     <br>
     Lord, we had a handful every day
     <br>
     <br>
     Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt ... Moo!
     <br>
     Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt ... Moo!
     <br>
     <br>
     We created quite a spectacle, I grant you
     <br>
     But we milked her just as pretty as you please
     <br>
     And while people said "How funny,", we raked in enough durn money
     <br>
     To go out and order ermine BVD's
     <br>
     <br>
     Father turned her on her back one Sunday morning
     <br>
     Gladys said "I'm upside down, now what's the gag?"
     <br>
     "Well, the reason why," said Pop "is so the cream will be on top."
     <br>
     "Gosh," the cow said, "in that case, it's in the bag!"
     <br>
     <br>
     Pass the udder udder over to my brudder
     <br>
     Pass the udder udder this-a-way
     <br>
     So we passed the udder udder and I passed it to my brudder
     <br>
     Lord, we had a handful every day
     <br>
     <br>
     Gladys she was quite a star in cattle circles
     <br>
     Though she couldn't read or write her name in full
     <br>
     You would think she'd been to college, although she herself acknowledged
     <br>
     That she gained her fame entirely by pull
     <br>
     <br>
     Gladys said to us one cold December morning
     <br>
     She said "Milking is the thing I dearly love
     <br>
     But when I get a cold it lingers, and I can't stand icy fingers
     <br>
     So go back into the house and get your gloves!"
     <br>
     <br>
     Pass the udder udder over to my brudder
     <br>
     Pass the udder udder this-a-way
     <br>
     So we passed the udder udder and I passed it to my brudder
     <br>
     Lord, we had a handful every day
