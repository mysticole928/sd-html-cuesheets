<br><br>Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt ... Moo!<br>

Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt ... Moo!<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">I been across the nation many times now</P><br><br>I've been taking all the ribbin', lettin' people do their fibbin'<br>

Here's one thing that I've just got to tell<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Way down south in ol' Jack County down in Texas</P><br><br>They made doctors, farmers, preachers, superintendents and school teachers<br>

And maybe I'm the one who likes to yarn<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Pass the udder udder over to my udder brudder</P><br><br>So we passed the udder udder and I passed it to my brudder<br>

Lord, we had a handful every day<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">They say things grow big up in Alaska</P><br><br>To a cow that we once had us, the name of her was Gladys<br>

Boy, you should have seen the neighbors stand and stare<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">She stood 10 feet tall and had one purple eyeball</P><br><br>She had 27 spigots, and the tourists all bought tickets<br>

Just to watch us milk and hear us loudly cry-y-y-y...<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Pass the udder udder over to my udder brudder</P><br><br>So we passed the udder udder and I passed it to my brudder<br>

Lord, we had a handful every day<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt ... Moo!</P><br><br><P CLASS="hdr">We created quite a spectacle, I grant you</P><br><br>And while people said "How funny,", we raked in enough durn money<br>

To go out and order ermine BVD's<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Father turned her on her back one Sunday morning</P><br><br>"Well, the reason why," said Pop "is so the cream will be on top."<br>

"Gosh," the cow said, "in that case, it's in the bag!"<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Pass the udder udder over to my brudder</P><br><br>So we passed the udder udder and I passed it to my brudder<br>

Lord, we had a handful every day<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Gladys she was quite a star in cattle circles</P><br><br>You would think she'd been to college, although she herself acknowledged<br>

That she gained her fame entirely by pull<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Gladys said to us one cold December morning</P><br><br>But when I get a cold it lingers, and I can't stand icy fingers<br>

So go back into the house and get your gloves!"<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Pass the udder udder over to my brudder</P><br><br>So we passed the udder udder and I passed it to my brudder<br>

Lord, we had a handful every day<br>
