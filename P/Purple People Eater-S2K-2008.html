<BR>
The Purple People Eater<BR>
<BR>
Well, I saw the thing comin' out of the sky, It had one long horn and one big eye. <BR>
I commenced a shaking and I said &quot;Ooo-Eee, It looks like a Purple People Eater to me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It was a one-eyed, one-horned flying Purple People Eater, One-eyed, one-horned flying Purple People Eater, <BR>
A one-eyed, one-horned flying Purple People Eater, Sure looked strange to me!<BR>
<BR>
Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree. I said &quot;Mister Purple People Eater, don't eat me.&quot; <BR>
I heard him say in a voice so gruff.. &quot;I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It was a one-eyed, one-horned flying Purple People Eater, One-eyed, one-horned flying Purple People Eater, <BR>
One-eyed, one-horned flying Purple People Eater, Sure looked strange to me!<BR>
<BR>
I said &quot;Mister Purple People Eater, what's your line-&quot; He said &quot;Eatin' purple people, and it sure
is fine. <BR>
But that's not the reason that I came to land, I want to get a job in a rock and roll band.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Well bless my soul, rock &amp; roll, flying Purple People Eater, Pidgeon-toed undercode flying Purple People Eater
<BR>
'We wear short shorts,&quot; friendly little people-eater, What a sight to see!<BR>
<BR>
And then he swung from the tree, and he lit on the ground, And he started to rock, really rockin' around. <BR>
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin'tune, In-a bop, bap a-boopin lap-a birn bam boom&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Well, bless my soul, rock &amp; roll, flying Purple People Eater, Pidgeon toed, undercode, flying Purple People
Eater, <BR>
&quot;I like short shorts,&quot; flying Purple People Eater, Quite a sight to see!<BR>
<BR>
Well, he went on his way and then, what do you know- I saw him last night on a TV show. <BR>
He was blowin' it out, really knocking 'em dead, Playing rock and roll music through the horn in his head.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tequila&quot;<BR>
