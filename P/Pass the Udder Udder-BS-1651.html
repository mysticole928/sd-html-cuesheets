     I've been across this nation many times now
     <br>
     East to west, north to south as well
     <br>
     I've been taking all the ribbin'
     <br>
     Lettin' people do their fibbing
     <br>
     Now here's one thing that I've just got to tell
     <br>
     Way down south in old Jack county down in Texas
     <br>
     Was born thirteen children on a farm
     <br>
     They made doctors, farmers, preachers
     <br>
     Superintendents and school teachers
     <br>
     And me, I'm the one who like to yarn

     They say things grow big up in Alaska
     <br>
     But there's nothing in that state can quite compare
     <br>
     To a cow that we once had us
     <br>
     And the name of her was Gladys
     <br>
     Boy you should have seen the neighbors stand and stare
     <br>
     She stood ten foot tall and had one purple eyeball
     <br>
     It took eight of us to milk her, here is why
     <br>
     She had 27 spigots and the tourists all bought tickets
     <br>
     Just to watch us milk and hear us loudly cry

     We created quite a spectacle I'll grant you
     <br>
     But we miled her just as pretty as you please
     <br>
     And while people said how funny
     <br>
     We raked in enough durn money
     <br>
     To go out and order Avin BVD's
     <br>
     Father turned her on her back one Sunday morning
     <br>
     Gladys said "I'm upside down, now what's the gag?"
     <br>
     "Well the reason why", said Pop
     <br>
     "Is so the cream will be on top"
     <br>
     "Gosh", the cow said, "in that case, it's in the bag"

     Though she couldn't read or write her name in full
     <br>
     You would think she'd been to college
     <br>
     Although she, herself, acknowledged
     <br>
     That she gained her fame entirely by pull
     <br>
     Glady said to us one cold, December morning
     <br>
     She said "milking is the thing I dearly love,
     <br>
     But when I get a cold it lingers
     <br>
     And I can't stand icy fingers
     <br>
     So go back into the house and get your gloves"
