    I've been across this nation many times now
    <br/>
    East to west, north to south as well
    <br/>
    I've been taking all the ribbin'
    <br/>
    Lettin' people do their fibbing
    <br/>
    Now here's one thing that I've just got to tell
    <br/>
    Way down south in old Jack county down in Texas
    <br/>
    Was born thirteen children on a farm
    <br/>
    They made doctors, farmers, preachers
    <br/>
    Superintendents and school teachers
    <br/>
    And me, I'm the one who like to yarn

    Pass the udder udder dis a way

    So we pass the udder udder and I'd pass it to my brudder

    Boys we had our hands full every day

    They say things grow big up in Alaska
    <br/>
    But there's nothing in that state can quite compare
    <br/>
    To a cow that we once had us
    <br/>
    And the name of her was Gladys
    <br/>
    Boy you should have seen the neighbors stand and stare
    <br/>
    She stood ten foot tall and had one purple eyeball
    <br/>
    It took eight of us to milk her, here is why
    <br/>
    She had 27 spigots and the tourists all bought tickets
    <br/>
    Just to watch us milk and hear us loudly cry

    We created quite a spectacle I'll grant you
    <br/>
    But we miled her just as pretty as you please
    <br/>
    And while people said how funny
    <br/>
    We raked in enough durn money
    <br/>
    To go out and order Avin BVD's
    <br/>
    Father turned her on her back one Sunday morning
    <br/>
    Gladys said "I'm upside down, now what's the gag?"
    <br/>
    "Well the reason why", said Pop
    <br/>
    "Is so the cream will be on top"
    <br/>
    "Gosh", the cow said, "in that case, it's in the bag"

    Gladys, she was quite a star in cattle

    Though she couldn't read or write her name in full
    <br/>
    You would think she'd been to college
    <br/>
    Although she, herself, acknowledged
    <br/>
    That she gained her fame entirely by pull
    <br/>
    Glady said to us one cold, December morning
    <br/>
    She said "milking is the thing I dearly love,
    <br/>
    But when I get a cold it lingers
    <br/>
    And I can't stand icy fingers
    <br/>
    So go back into the house and get your gloves"
