<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L></L></FONT>I've been across this nation many times now<br>
East to west, north to south as well<br>
I've been taking all the ribbin'<br>
Lettin' people do their fibbing<br>
Now here's one thing that I've just got to tell<br>
Way down south in old Jack county down in Texas<br>
Was born thirteen children on a farm<br>
They made doctors, farmers, preachers<br>
Superintendents and school teachers<br>
And me, I'm the one who like to yarn<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CHORUS</P><br><br>Pass the udder udder over to my udder brudder<br>
Pass the udder udder dis a way<br>
So we pass the udder udder and I'd pass it to my brudder<br>
Boys we had our hands full every day<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>They say things grow big up in Alaska<br>
But there's nothing in that state can quite compare<br>
To a cow that we once had us<br>
And the name of her was Gladys<br>
Boy you should have seen the neighbors stand and stare<br>
She stood ten foot tall and had one purple eyeball<br>
It took eight of us to milk her, here is why<br>
She had 27 spigots and the tourists all bought tickets<br>
Just to watch us milk and hear us loudly cry<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CHORUS:</P><br><br>FIGURE<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">We created quite a spectacle I'll grant you</P><br><br>And while people said how funny<br>
We raked in enough durn money<br>
To go out and order Avin BVD's<br>
Father turned her on her back one Sunday morning<br>
Gladys said "I'm upside down, now what's the gag?"<br>
"Well the reason why", said Pop<br>
"Is so the cream will be on top"<br>
"Gosh", the cow said, "in that case, it's in the bag"<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CHORUS:</P><br><br>FIGURE<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">Gladys, she was quite a star in cattle <C>circle</C>s</P><br><br>You would think she'd been to college<br>
Although she, herself, acknowledged<br>
That she gained her fame entirely by pull<br>
Glady said to us one cold, December morning<br>
She said "milking is the thing I dearly love,<br>
But when I get a cold it lingers<br>
And I can't stand icy fingers<br>
So go back into the house and get your gloves"<br>
