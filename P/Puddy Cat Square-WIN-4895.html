<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>Do an allemande left with the corner, come back do a dosado<br>
Gents star left in the middle of the ring, it's once around you go<br>
Same little lady turn thru and you go left allemande<br>
Hey come on back and promenade, keep walking around that land<br>
Head couples wheel around, and do the right & left thru<br>
Star thru then pass thru and you go left allemande<br>
Dosado with the next one, then promenade the land<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>That pretty little girl with the turned-up nose<br>
Freckled face and, I suppose, that's why they call her puddy cat<br>
M-E-O-W...</L></FONT><br>

Head 2 couples promenade, go halfway round that town<br>
The lead to the right and circle 4, you make a line for me<br>
Go forward 8 and come on back, then star thru you see<br>
Do an eight chain 3, you pull her by, with the corner lady swing<br>
You swing the girl around, and you go left allemande<br>
