<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P>
<BR><BR>
Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea<BR>
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honalee<BR>
</SPAN>Allemande left and weave<SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><BR>
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal puff</SPAN><BR>
Promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff<BR>
</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P>
<BR><BR>
Heads promenade three quarters<BR>
Sides do the right and left thru<BR>
Pass thru and then Swing thru my friend<BR>
Boys run right you bend the line<BR>
Touch a quarter, circulate, boys run right<BR>
Swing the corner girl and promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name<BR>
</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P>
<BR><BR>
Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">A dragon lives forever but not so little boys<BR>
Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys<BR>
</SPAN>Allemande left and weave<SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><BR>
One grey night it happened Jackie Paper came no more</SPAN><BR>
Promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And Puff that magic dragon he ceased his fearless roar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">CLOSER</P>
<BR><BR>
Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">His head was bent in sorrow green scales fell like rain<BR>
Puff no longer went to play along the Cherry Lane<BR>
</SPAN>Allemande left and weave<SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><BR>
Without his life long friend Puff could not be brave</SPAN><BR>
Promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">So Puff the magic dragon sadly slipped into his cave</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">TAG</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Puff the magic dragon lives in Honalee</SPAN><BR>
