<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>What'll you do when you get lonely<br>

And no one's waiting by your side?<br>

You've been running and hiding much too long<br>

You know it's just your foolish pride<br><br>



Chorus:<br>

Layla, got me on my knees,<br>

Layla, Begging, darling please, Layla,<br>

Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?<br><br>



I tried to give you consolation<br>

When your old man had let you down<br>

Like a fool, I fell in love with you<br>

Turned my whole world upside down<br><br>



Let's make the best of the situation<br>

Before I finally go insane<br>

Please don't say we'll never find a way<br>

And tell me all my love's in vain<br>
