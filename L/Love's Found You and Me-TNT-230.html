Walk around that corner lady, see saw your own<br>

Men star by the right go once around<br>

Pick up the partner arm around and star promenade<br>

Girls roll back, left allemande and weave<br>

Heads promenade half way around now<br>

Down the middle with right and left thru and then<br>

Square thru four hands, go walking round the land<br>

To the outside to you the right and left thru<br>

Now roll a way with a half sashay and pass thru<br>

Do a U-turn back, swing that corner girl and promenade her home<br>
