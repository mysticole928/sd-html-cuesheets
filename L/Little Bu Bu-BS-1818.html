   </c>
   :
From a square formation all four gents move to the left while the ladies move to the right.  All pass right shoulders with the corner and move on to the next touching right hands as they go by.  The gents now move to the inside to pass left shoulders with the next moving on to meet their partners with a left hand and a courtesy turn.
A. Four Couples Cross Trail:
Start in the same manner and from the same position.  However, in this figure there are no hands used.  All pass right shoulders with the corner and right shoulders with the next.  Gents now move to the inside and pass left shoulders with the next moving on to pass left shoulders with their partners to end facing out with their partners on their left.

B.  Four Couples Pass Thru:
Start in the same manner and from the same position.  In this figure there are no hands used.  All pass right shoulders with the corner and right shoulders with the next.  Gents now move to the inside and pass left shoulders with the next moving on to stop facing out, with their partners on their right.

C.  Four Couples Pass Left Thru:
Started from a square in half sashay position.  In this figure there are no hands used.  All pass left shoulders with the right hand lady and left shoulders with the next.  Gents now move to the inside and pass right shoulders with the next moving on to stop facing out, with their partners on their left.

D.  Four Couples Susie Q:
Start in the same manner and from the same position.  All pass right shoulders with the corners then turn the next with a right forearm to return to the same corner passing left shoulders moving on to turn partner with a left forearm.
