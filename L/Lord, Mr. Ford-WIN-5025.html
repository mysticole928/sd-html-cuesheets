<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*I'm not a man to point or judge, I'm not a man to hold a grudge<br>
But I think it's time to say a few choice words</L></FONT><br>
Do an allemande left that corner girl, dosado around the world<br>
Left allemande and weave around the ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Lord, Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see</L></FONT><br>
Dosado and then promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well, it seems your contribution to man<br>

Sweep 1/4 more and pass thru, swing thru<br>

***Now cross trail thru and the corner lady swing<br>
Do an allemande left, come back and promenade<br>

Guess we'd all been born with a parkin' place</L></FONT><br>
