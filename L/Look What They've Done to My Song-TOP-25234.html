<P CLASS="hdr">BREAK</P><br><br>4 ladies chain across that ring now<br>
Whirl away and circle to the left go round<br>
Walk all around that corner girl, your partner dopaso<br>
Her left and the corner by the right you know<br>
Your partner left a full turn, look for the right hand girl<br>
You swing that girl and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>It's the only thing I could do half right, and it's turning out all wrong<br>
Look what they've done to my song</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>The heads star thru and everybody double pass thru<br>
Centers in, cast off 3/4 round<br>
Star thru, substitute, in the middle pass thru<br>
Do a dosado, make an ocean wave you know<br>
All 8 circulate, star thru and then slide thru<br>
Swing that corner girl and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>They wrapped it up in a plastic bag and turned it upside down<br>
Look what they've done to my song</L></FONT><br>
