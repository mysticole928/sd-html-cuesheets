<P CLASS="hdr">VERSE</P><br><br>When the sun goes down in El Paso; and the stars come out over Dallas<br>
The evening tide is rolling in; out on Galveston Bay<br>
Cowboys are cleaning up their pickup trucks<br>
Shining their boots and praying for luck<br>
It's a lone star loving night<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CHORUS</P><br><br>It's a lone star loving night; an ice cold beer will make it alright<br>
Big blue eyes and tight levi's; a cowgirl to hold you tight<br>
It's a lone star loving night<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">VERSE</P><br><br>All week long they've been working like slaves<br>
Trying to make it through one more day<br>
The doctor and the lawyer and the business man<br>
The secretary and the red neck hand<br>
They're punching the clock and changing their clothes<br>
Heading out to the dance hall floors; it's a lone star loving night<br>
