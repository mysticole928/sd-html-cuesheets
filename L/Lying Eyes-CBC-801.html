She'll dress all up in lace and go in style</L></FONT><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You can't hide your lyin' eyes<br>

And your smile is a thin disguise<br>

I thought by now you'd realize<br>

There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes</L></FONT><br>

With firey eyes and dreams no one could steal<br>

She drives on through the night anticipating<br>

'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel<br>

<BR>*She wonders how it ever got this crazy<br>Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?<br>

She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool</L></FONT><br>
