Before you came, my time was running low<br>
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed<br>
My bridges all were crossed</L></FONT><br>
4 ladies chain, turn that girl<br>
Chain 'em home again, roll promenade around, you're doing fine<br>

Now allemande new corner, you weave around the ring then<br>
When you meet, promenade by two<br>
