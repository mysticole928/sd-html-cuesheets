Dip and dive around the square, home you go and don't you blunder<br>
Your corners allemande, put an arm around your partner<br>
Star promenade her, do the Jessie Polka dance (*see comments)<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>With a heel and a toe, we'll start the room a-jumping</L></FONT><br>
Girls roll back 1 <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>you can see their bustles bumping<br>
We'll dance through the night as if it were a minute<br>
Our hearts are really in it</L></FONT>, do the Jessie Polka dance*<br>
Watch for the corner girl, when she comes around<br>
Take her in your arms and swing her round and round<br>
Promenade her home and keep her for your partner<br>
Get home and swing her till the music starts again<br>
