<P CLASS="hdr">---</P><br><br>Folkraft record number 1289 is the fourth in our series of modern "Progressive dances", and note that we sub-titled it "A Modern Contra", which it really is. It is a contra dance in which there are no in-active couples. Everybody is active and moving. The same movement is always performed to the same strain of music. The dance is a happy one, and the progression is new. It involves some new "basics".<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">Note that we have skipped the "set-up promenade". After the experience of dance 1, 2, and 3 in this series, the dancer and caller should now be acquainted with the idea of the "progressive circle". The "set-up" for "Jingle Bells" can be accomplished by "Promenade two, promenade four, and bend the line," which gives you two large circles of couples. The inside couples with their backs to the center of the circle, and outside couples facing the center, which divides up into individual units of couple facing couple.</P><br><br>The first call "balance partners all", is performed as follows: with inside hands joined, merely balance left and right, then side-step, step left and draw the right foot to it, and repeat: step left, draw right, to left foot. The next call is a right & left across the set". Do a right & left thru across the set, and again balance with partners, first left then right, two side-step steps. The next call is familiar. "Cross trail, and u-turn back, then make a left hand star." Halfway around with the star, and if you will look to the right, you will see the same couple that you faced after the side-step in A1. It is nice at this time to greet them with a "hello". With that new couple, two ladies chain, then chain back, and with the same two, a right & left thru. Turn your girl, and again (A1) balance all. The "right & left thru" in B2 is the progression.<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">The instrumental side can not only be used for the "Grand Circle", but is very useful for any Christmas square dance or couple dance for which you would like to use it. There are many traditional folk dances performed to this music.</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
