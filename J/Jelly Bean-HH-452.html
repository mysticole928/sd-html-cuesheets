<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>(He's got those) Fancy boots that really fit<br>
His pants and shirt are made of double knit<br>
So just swing Ol' Jelly Bean</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE (call four times through)</P><br><br>Walk around your corner, see saw round your pet<br>
Head two couples up and back and turn thru like that<br>
Separate and then you travel round just one<br>
Come into the middle, make a left hand star, once around you run<br>
Put your arm around your corner, take 'em with you watch 'em grin<br>
Inside out, outside in (1/2 turn) now the inside ladies roll away 1/2 sashay<br>
Then all four ladies back-track, go round the other way<br>
Turn 'em left around, keep 'em, promenade around<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Who is that guy? That's Ol' Jelly Bean<br>
So swing Ol' Jelly Bean</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK (may be used in center or as a closer - one time only)</P><br><br>Join hands, circle left, make a great big ring<br>
Turn to the corner, swing, swing, everybody swing<br>
Allemande left new corner, dosado your own<br>
Go back and swing that corner girl as though she were your own<br>
And then you join hands, circle left, let me see you smile<br>
Reverse that ring, single file<br>
Gents reach back your right hand and box the gnat<br>
Make a right hand star, all eight of you & then right after that<br>
Girls turn back for a left allemande<br>
Keep that fellow, promenade that man<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Who is he?  That's Ol' Jelly Bean<br>
Swing Ol' Jelly Bean</L></FONT><br>
