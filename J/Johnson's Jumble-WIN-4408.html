     First couple stand back-to-back, boompsa daisy, go round that track
     <br>
     It's all around the ring you go, while the birdies sing and the roosters crow
     <br>
     Right on by your own, you see, to the corner couple and circle three
     <br>
     When you get near home stand three in line, go forward and back, you're doin' fine
     <br>
     Couple number three you swing with pride, now zig-zag through the three on the sides
     <br>
     Go out and in and out once more, now sashay down the middle of the floor
     <br>
     And you back right up to a line of four
     <br>
     Go forward eight and back with you, center four do a right &amp; left thru
     <br>
     Now the four men left with a half sashay, forward eight and back that way
     <br>
     Now pass right thru and turn to the right, go single file around that site
     <br>
     With a right hand in you form a star, and walk right around but not too far
     <br>
     Now the gents reach under with your left, and pull her on thru to an allemande thar
     <br>
     And you back 'em up, boys, in a right hand star, walk along backwards not too far
     <br>
     Eight roll away with a half sashay, back 'em, boys, in the same old way
     <br>
     Now throw out the clutch and put 'er in low, it's twice around that ring you go
     <br>
     Now turn the next with a right hand swing, it's twice around with the dear little thing
     <br>
     And the gents star left 3/4 round, to a right &amp; left grand as you come down
     <br>
     Go hand over hand 'til you meet that maid, take 'er by the hand and promenade
     <br>

     Now the second and fourth you swing some more
     <br>

     <br>
     Go forward eight and back with you, forward again and pass right thru
     <br>
     Join hands again, the ends turn in
     <br>
     Circle four in the middle of the floor, go one time around with the pretty little thing
     <br>
     Now pass right thru and split that ring, and around just one
     <br>
     Do an allemande left with the corners all, and a right &amp; left grand, go round the hall
     <br>
     Shuffle along 'til you meet that maid, take her by the hand and promenade
     <br>
     Promenade and don't slow down, now two and four pivot around
     <br>
     Do a right &amp; left thru with the couple you've found
     <br>
     And the ladies chain like you always do, then forward up and pass right thru
     <br>
     And turn to the right go single file, with the gent in the lead, Indian style
     <br>
     The gent's in front of his partner
     <br>
     Now the gents step out, go the other way, meet your partner with a left all around
     <br>
     And on to the right and promenade, and don't slow down
     <br>
     Now one and three pivot around, do a right &amp; left thru with the couple you've found
     <br>
     Now down the line you chain that gal, and promenade the old corral
     <br>
     Promenade, all the way around, with the right foot up and the left foot down
     <br>

     Walk all around your left hand lady, see saw your pretty little taw
     <br>
     Give a left to the corner like allemande thar, back 'em up, boys, in a right hand star
     <br>
     Now shoot that star with a once and a half, and the ladies star with a pretty little laugh
     <br>
     To the opposite man for an allemande thar, girls back up but not too far
     <br>
     And you back up, girls, in a pretty little star
     <br>
     Shoot that star to your corner, pal, with a right go full around that gal
     <br>
     It's all the way round to a left allemande, partners by the right and a right &amp; left grand
     <br>
     It's hand over hand around that ring
     <br>
     And when you meet your lady fair, promenade around that square
     <br>
     I've got a girl and she's a fright, she likes to square dance every night
     <br>
     When we get home she takes three swings, it makes me do the darnedest things!
     <br>
     Now bow to your partners, corners all; and keeno, boys, that's it...that's all!
