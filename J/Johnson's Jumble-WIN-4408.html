    First couple stand back-to-back, boompsa daisy, go round that track
    <br>
    It's all around the ring you go, while the birdies sing and the roosters crow
    <br>
    Right on by your own, you see, to the corner couple and circle three
    <br>
    When you get near home stand three in line, go forward and back, you're doin' fine
    <br>
    Couple number three you swing with pride, now zig-zag through the three on the sides
    <br>
    Go out and in and out once more, now sashay down the middle of the floor

    And you back right up to a line of four
    <br>
    Go forward eight and back with you, center four do a right &amp; left thru
    <br>
    Now the four men left with a half sashay, forward eight and back that way
    <br>
    Now pass right thru and turn to the right, go single file around that site
    <br>
    With a right hand in you form a star, and walk right around but not too far
    <br>
    Now the gents reach under with your left, and pull her on thru to an allemande thar
    <br>
    And you back 'em up, boys, in a right hand star, walk along backwards not too far
    <br>
    Eight roll away with a half sashay, back 'em, boys, in the same old way
    <br>
    Now throw out the clutch and put 'er in low, it's twice around that ring you go
    <br>
    Now turn the next with a right hand swing, it's twice around with the dear little thing
    <br>
    And the gents star left 3/4 round, to a right &amp; left grand as you come down
    <br>

    Walk all around your left hand lady, see saw your pretty little taw
    <br>

    <br>
    Now shoot that star with a once and a half, and the ladies star with a pretty little laugh
    <br>
    To the opposite man for an allemande thar, girls back up but not too far
    <br>
    And you back up, girls, in a pretty little star
    <br>
    Shoot that star to your corner, pal, with a right go full around that gal
    <br>
    It's all the way round to a left allemande, partners by the right and a right &amp; left grand
    <br>
    It's hand over hand around that ring
    <br>
    And when you meet your lady fair, promenade around that square
    <br>
    I've got a girl and she's a fright, she likes to square dance every night
    <br>
    When we get home she takes three swings, it makes me do the darnedest things!
    <br>
    Now bow to your partners, corners all; and keeno, boys, that's it...that's all!
