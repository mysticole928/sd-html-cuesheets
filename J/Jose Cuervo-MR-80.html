<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>* Now wait a minute, things don't look too familiar<br>
and who is this Cowgirl who's laying beside me<br>
She's awful cute but how'd she get my shirt on<br>
I had too much tequila last night
<br><br>
* All those little shooters how I love to drink them down<br>
Come on bartender lets have another round<br>
Well the music is playing and my spirits are high<br>
Tomorrow might be painful but tonight I'm gonna fly<br><br>
**Every time we get together I sure have a good time<br>
You're my friend, you're the best - Sides Face, Grand Square<br>
