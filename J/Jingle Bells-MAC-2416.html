<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - BREAK - CLOSER</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
(Pre-cue) Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Christmas eve is here, and we go off to bed <BR>
as we climb the stairs and nod our sleepy heads<BR>
Take our stockings off, hang them in a row<BR>
Then jump quickly into bed</SPAN> Four ladies chain you know<BR>
Chain the ladies over, you turn and chain them back<BR>
Now turn the girl with the rosy cheeks and promenade the track<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way<BR>
Hurrah for dear old Santa Claus, Hurrah for Christmas Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
Heads right and left thru, you turn your little girl<BR>
And then half square thru, now touch a quarter friend<BR>
Split circulate and now scoot back, put the ladies in<BR>
Do a walk and dodge and then, do a partner trade my friend<BR>
Square thru three hands and the corner lady swing<BR>
Swing Merry Christmas (Rudolph, Carol, Santa Claus) <BR>
Now promenade the ring<SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><BR>
Oh what fund it is to ride in a one horse sleigh tonight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK (AUSTRALIANA)</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Dashing through the bush in a rusty Holden Ute<BR>
Kicking up the dust, esky in the boot<BR>
Kelpie by my side, singing Christmas songs<BR>
It's summertime and I am in my singlet, shorts and thongs</SPAN> Four ladies chain you know<BR>
Chain the ladies over, you turn and chain them back<BR>
Now turn the girl with the rosy cheeks and promenade the track<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way<BR>
Oh what fun it is to drive my rusty Holden Ute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">ENDING (AUSTRALIANA)</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Rust and smoke, the heater broke, the door just blew away<BR>
You light a match to see the dash, then you start to pray<BR>
The frame is bent, the muffler went, the radio it's okay<BR>
Oh what fun it is to drive my rusty Holden Ute</SPAN> Four ladies chain you know<BR>
Chain the ladies over, you turn and chain them back<BR>
Now turn the girl with the rosy cheeks and promenade the track<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way<BR>
Oh what fun it is to drive my rusty Holden Ute</SPAN></P>
