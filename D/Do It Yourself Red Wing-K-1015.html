Allemande left with your old left hand<br>
Weave the ring, don't just stand<br>
Weave them in and out, until you meet your own<br>
Dosado, it's back to back, step right up and swing<br>
Then you swing, swing tonight, <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>oh pretty red wing</L></FONT><br>
Then promenade her and serenade her<br>
Yes you swing, swing tonight, <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>oh pretty red wing<br>
While red wing cries her heart away</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>First old couple lead out to the right and circle halfway round<br>
You dip and dive and away you go, the inside high the outside low<br>
Hurry, hurry, let's go, it's over and then below<br>
You dive right thru and on to the next, circle halfway round<br>
Then you dive right thru and on to the next, and circle halfway round<br>
You dip and dive and away you go, the inside high and the outside low<br>
Dip and dive across that track, you dip and dive a coming back<br>
Dive right thru and home you do and everybody swing<br>
Then you swing, swing tonight, <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>oh pretty red wing</L></FONT><br>
Then promenade her and serenade her<br>
Yes you swing, swing tonight, <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>oh pretty red wing<br>
