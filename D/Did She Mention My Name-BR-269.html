Grand Square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day<br>
</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And talk about the hometown a million miles away<br>
</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Is the ice still in the river, are the old folks still the same?<br>
</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And by the way, did she mention my name?<br>
</L></FONT>Four ladies chain straight across, turn and chain the ladies home<br>
Take her by the hand and then promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all their games?<br>

Heads promenade and go halfway around that ring<br>
Come down the middle, right & left thru, turn the girl I sing<br>
Flutter wheel across, sweep 1/4 more<br>
Pass thru and a right & left thru, turn the girl once more<br>
Swing thru and then those boys run to the right<br>
Half tag, swing the corner, you promenade tonight<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Is the old roof still leaking, when the big snow turns to rain?<br>

Four ladies chain, go straight across that ring<br>
You roll away and circle, you circle to the left I sing<br>
Four ladies roll away and then you circle to the left that way<br>
Left allemande, weave around that ring<br>
Did she mention my name just in passing?<br>
Swing the girl and then, we'll all promenade<br>
