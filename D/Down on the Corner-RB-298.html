<span style="background-color: #FCC9C3">*Early in the evenin´, just about 
suppertime<br>
Over by the courthouse they´re starting to unwind<br>
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up<br>
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp<br>
</span>Allemande left &amp; Weave the ring<br>
<span style="background-color: #FCC9C3">Down on the corner, out in the street<br>
</span>Swing that lady and you Promenade her too<span style="background-color: #FCC9C3"><br>
Down on the corner, out in the street<br>
Willy and the poor boys are playing, bring a nickel, tap your feet</span><br><br><P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads 
Dosado and then
Square thru my friend<br>
(Sides face Grand Square)<br>
Heads cloverleaf and then walk in and Pass thru<br>
Heads cloverleaf again and walk right in<br>
Heads you
Square thru three quarters round now<br>
Swing the corner and Promenade the town<br>

<span style="background-color: #FCC9C3">*Rooster hits the washboard and people 
just got to smile,<br>
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while<br>
Poor boys twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo<br>
Billy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo<br>
<br>
*You don´t need a penny just to hang around<br>
But, if you´ve got a nickel, won´t you lay your money down<br>
Over on the corner there´s a happy noise<br>
People come from all around to watch the magic boys.</span></BODY></HTML>
