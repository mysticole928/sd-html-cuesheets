Heads [Sides] Square Thru four hands ‘round and roll it inside of the set.<br>
When you meet the sides, you make a Right Hand Star, you bet.<br>
One time around and then, the Heads Star Left inside you go.<br>
All the way to the corner lady, Touch a Quarter there you know, Scoot Back.<br>
Make it two times, my friend (ah ha).<br>
Swing and Promenade around the land (oh no).<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">ADDITIONAL LYRICS</P><br><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Well this crooked little man and his crooked little smile<br>
Took his crooked sixpence and he walked a crooked mile (Reverse)<br>
Bought some crooked nails and a crooked little bat,<br>
And he tried to fix his roof, Four Ladies Chain, rat-a-tat-tat (ah ha).<br><br>

*Now this crooked little man and his crooked cat and mouse,<br>
They all lived together in the crooked little house (Reverse).<br>
Has a crooked door with a crooked little latch,<br>
Has a crooked roof, Four Ladies Chain across the set (ah ha)<br>
