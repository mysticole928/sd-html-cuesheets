<P CLASS="hdr">*Cloverflow: is done from a normal Trade By position (i.e., two couples in the center of the square facing into the square and two couples on the outside facing out). On the call Cloverflow, the couples facing in pass thru while the couples facing out do a cloverleaf.  Then the new couples facing in (i.e., those who were facing out before) pass thru, while the new couples facing out (i.e., those who were facing in before) do a cloverleaf.  The movement ends when two couples at each end of the square are facing each other (i.e., in an Eight Chain Thru position).</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
