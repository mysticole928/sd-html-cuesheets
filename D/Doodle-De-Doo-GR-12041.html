The men wheel in the right hand in, oh boy, what a star<br>
Let the star to the heavens whirl, go right & left to the second girl<br>
New thar, brand new star, wheel in again<br>
Well shoot the star, go right & left grand<br>
It's every other girl, with every other hand<br>
When you meet your lady fair, you dosado around her there<br>
Promenade, come-a 2 by 2, you take her home with you<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She'll doodle-de-doo, doodle-de-doo, doodle-de-doo with you</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>4 little ladies promenade around inside the big old ring<br>
Home you go, box the gnat, men star left, get moving men<br>
Home you go, it's catch all 8 with the right hand 1/2 way round<br>
Back by the left, go all the way round, find the corner dosado<br>
Around that corner, then you run back home and see saw around your own<br>
That corner swing and whirl, promenade that pretty girl<br>
Promenade, come-a 2 by 2, you take her home with you<br>
