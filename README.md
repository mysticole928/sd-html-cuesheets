# sd-html-cuesheets

A reminder.  I did not create these cuesheets.  These are the cuesheets that came with Sqmp3. As I recall, Dave Wilson, the original creator of Sqmp3, got the cuesheets from Thomas Behrend of Sq View fame. However, I'm not sure of this.

Over time, I've added the cuesheets to songs I've purchased.
