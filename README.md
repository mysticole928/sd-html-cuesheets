# sd-html-cuesheets

I did not create these cuesheets.  They've come from multiple sources including (but not limited to) Dave Wilson's SqMP3 program, SqView, various square dance music producers, and ceder.net.

## How to use

You can either download this as a zip archive and extract it wherever you'd like or use git.  If you use git, you can get only the updates/changes as needed instead of downloading the full archive every time. 

### Special Characters in filenames

Most modern operating systems can have special characters in their filenames.  It used to be that only letters and numbers were okay.  

In this archive, filenames include single quotes, exclamation marks, and other punctuation.  While this has not been an issue on Windows and Macs, some cloud providers will not allow it in their online storage.  (For example, Microsoft's OneDrive. This archive, as is, causes OneDrive to have errors.)  Using a Zip archive resolves this.

### Using the command line and git

From the command line interface (CLI), you can use `git` to download the files directly.

Git is *not* automatically installed on computers.  It can be download from the web or using a package manager like Homebrew or Winget.

_Note: The folder must be empty to run this command the first time._

`git clone https://github.com/mysticole928/sd-html-cuesheets .`

Then, if you wish to have my updates in the future, run this command:

`git pull`
