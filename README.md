# sd-html-cuesheets

I did not create these cue sheets.  These are the cue sheets that came with the program Sqmp3 (originally created and sold by Dave Wilson) along with ones I've collected over the years with music I've purchased or from the website ceder.net. 

As I recall, Dave Wilson, got a set of cuesheets from Thomas Behrend of SqView fame. However, I'm not sure of this.

## How to use

You can download this as a zip archive and extract it wherever you'd like.  

### Special Characters in filenames

Most modern operating systems can have special characters in their filenames.  It used to be that only letters and numbers were okay.  In this archive, filenames include single quotes, exclamation marks, and other punctuation.  While this has not been an issue on Windows and Macs, some cloud providers will not allow it.  (For example, Microsoft's Office 365 includes a feature called OneDrive.  This archive, as is, causes OneDrive to have errors.)  Using a Zip archive resolves this.

### Using the command line

From the command line interface (CLI), you can use `git` to download the files directly.

Git is *not* automatically installed on computers.  It can be download from the web or using a package manager like Homebrew.

_Note: The folder must be empty to run this command the first time._

`git clone https://github.com/mysticole928/sd-html-cuesheets .`

Then, if you wish to have my updates in the future, run this command:

`git pull`

### MacOS Homebrew
Instructions on how to install Homebrew are here: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)
