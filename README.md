# sd-html-cuesheets

A reminder.  I did not create these cue sheets.  These are the cue sheets that came with the program Sqmp3 (originally created and sold by Dave Wilson) along with ones I've collected over the years with music I've purchased. 

As I recall, Dave Wilson, got a set of cuesheets from Thomas Behrend of SqView fame. However, I'm not sure of this.

## How to use

You can download this as a zip archive and extract it wherever you'd like.

From the command line interface (CLI), you can use `git` to download the files directly.

You'll need to be comfortable using the command line to do this.  On the Mac, use `Homebrew` to install `git`.

_Note: the folder must be empty to run this command_

`git clone https://github.com/mysticole928/sd-html-cuesheets .`

Then, if you wish to have my updates in the future, run this command:

`git pull`

### MacOS
