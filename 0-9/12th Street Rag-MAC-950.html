<P CLASS="hdr">BREAK</P><br><br><C></C>Allemande left the ladies star<br>
The gents go round the ring<br>
Allemande left, the gentlemen star<br>
The girls go round that ring<br>
Same girl, left allemande<br>
Grand right & left you know<br>
Hand over hand around that ring<br>
Meet your lady, hey dosado<br>
The gents star right across the town<br>
You'll turn the opposite girl<br>
Star right back across the set<br>
A left hand swing your pearl<br>
Balance out, bow real low, step right up, dosado<br>
Then swing her <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>to that Twelfth Street rag</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>You allemande left your corner girl<br>
Walk right by your own<br>
Dosado round your right hand girl<br>
Go home and swing your own<br>
The gents star left across the square<br>
We'll turn the opposite dears<br>
It's twice around, you turn them, boys<br>
Wagon wheel and strip the gears*<br>
Catch her by the left like a dopaso<br>
It's corners right hand round<br>
Partners by the left, the gents star right, go straight across the town<br>
You turn them by the left with a pretty little whirl<br>
Hey, swing, swing that corner girl<br>
Swing her <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>to that Twelfth Street rag</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">*Wagon wheel & strip the gears: Right forearm grip with partner.  Both walk forward (CW) a 3/4 turn, then the gent spins the lady into a right face turn and as she completes the full spin, he catches her with a left forearm grip to continue the dopaso movement.</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
