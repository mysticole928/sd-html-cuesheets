Cross trail back and split the ring and around just one you go<br>
Well into the middle you box the gnat<br>
Change hands a left square thru 3/4 round then do a right & left thru<br>
Well dive thru and pass thru then do a right & left thru<br>
Well a right & left back, your opposite a dosado<br>
Go all the way around to an ocean wave<br>
Well forward and back, do the right & left thru<br>
And do a cross trail back<br>
Well allemande left that corner girl and promenade your own<br>
Heads wheel around a right & left thru<br>
Then do a dixie chain<br>
Ladies go left, the gents go right, your corners box the flea<br>
Well promenade home <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*with a brand new gate of love</L></FONT><br>
