<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She said if I ever deceived her<br>
She'd be gone before I could count to ten<br>
I guess that I didn't believe her<br>
Now look at the trouble I'm in<br>
Cause she's gone, gone, gone...gone, gone, gone<br>
Cryin' won't bring her back<br>
The more that I cry, the faster that train flies<br>
Further on down the track</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 promenade you travel halfway<br>
Down the middle, you do a right & left thru and then<br>
2 & 4 square thru 4 hands around now<br>
Dosado that corner girl you do<br>
You're gonna swing thru and then, those boys trade and swing<br>
Swing that corner girl, promenade<br>

When I lost the girl that I found<br>
She swore she would leave and she left me<br>
Before my first tear hit the ground<br>
Now she's gone, gone, gone...gone, gone, gone<br>

I'd crawl there on my hands and knees<br>
Each tick of the clock is a reminder<br>
She's one second farther from me<br>
I know she's gone, gone, gone...gone, gone, gone<br>
Cryin' won't bring her back<br>
