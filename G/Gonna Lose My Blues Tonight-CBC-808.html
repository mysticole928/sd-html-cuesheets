<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Ah, you've done me wrong but it won't be long<br>
'til my blues are out of sight<br>
For that big green engine's ready to go<br>
Rollin' out of town tonight</L></FONT><br>
<C>Allemande</C> and <C>weave</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>See the steam and hear the whistle scream<br>
And we're off on a northern line<br>
The 5:38's never known to be late<br>
Rockin' and rollin' along on time</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr"><L>Ah, swing that coal and hear that engine roll</P><br><br>Women, wine and song, I've had you too long<br>
Gonna lose my blues tonight<br>
Now I've been in town and I've been fooling around<br>
And I've spent some time in goal<br>
Gonna start again, don't know where or when<br>
But tonight I'm changing my trail</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr"><L>It's good to see the bush-land free</P><br><br>And that old green rattler seems to know<br>
That I'm losing my blues tonight<br>
Ah, swing that coal and hear that engine roll<br>
Keep the signals clear tonight<br>
Let the smoke clouds fly, I'm saying goodbye<br>
I'm gonna lose my blues tonight</L></FONT><br>

Meet your corner girl and then <C>swing thru</C><br>
<C>Boys run right</C>, <C>couples circulate</C> tonight<br>
<C>Bend the line</C>, <C>reverse flutterwheel</C><br>
<C>Half-sashay</C>, then <C>star thru</C> that way<br>
<C>Trade by</C>, <C>swing your corner</C>, <C>promenade</C><br>
