<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P><br><br>Sides face, grand parade (spin, sweep, weave, square, etc.)<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>The old hometown looked the same<br>
As I stepped down from the train<br>
And there to greet me was my mama and my papa<br>
Down the road I looked and there runs Mary<br>
Hair of gold and lips like cherry<br>
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads (sides) square thru & go round the land<br>
Dosado with the corner my friend<br>
Spin chain thru, girls circulate twice and then<br>
Turn thru, left allemande the corner, dosado your own<br>
Swing the corner lady and promenade home<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>Sides face, grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>The old house is still standin'<br>
Though the paint is cracked and dry<br>
There's the old oak tree that I used to play on<br>
Down the lane I walked with my sweet Mary<br>
Hair of gold and lips like cherry<br>
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads curlique, walk & dodge you do<br>
Circle 4 make a line, then slide thru<br>
Spin chain the gears go all the way round and then<br>
When you meet square thru 3, go 3 hands<br>
Swing the corenr lady, promenade the lane<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">CLOSER</P><br><br>Sides face, grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Then I awoke and looked around me<br>
At the four grey walls that surround me<br>
And I realize, yes, I was only dreamin'<br>
And there's a guard and there's a sad old padre<br>
On and on, we'll walk at daybreak<br>
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home</L></FONT><br>
