And the trails to lead old cowboys home again</SPAN><BR>

Heads couples go right and left thru and turn 'em<BR>
Four couples roll away. Heads square thru four hands that way<BR>
Four hands and then, all four couples square thru<BR>
Three quarters go, at home dopaso<BR>

And the trails to lead old dancers home again</SPAN><BR>
