    <h1>OPENER</h1>
    <p>
      Sides face, Grand Square<br>
      <span class="lyrics">There's an old piano, and he plays it hot behind the green door<br>
      Don't know what they're doing but they laugh a lot behind the green door</span><br>
      Left Allemande, Weave the Ring<br>
      <span class="lyrics">I wish they'd let me in so I can find out what's behind the green door<br>
      Green door, what's that secret you're keeping?</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Break Lyrics</h2>
    <p class="lyrics">    
      I knocked one time, tried to tell 'em that I'd been there<br>
      A door slammed shut &mdash; hospitality's thin there<br>
      I wish I knew what's going on behind that ol' Green Door<br>
      Midnight, one more night without sleeping<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Closer Lyrics</h2>
    <p class="lyrics">
      I saw an eyeball peekin' through a smoky cloud behind the green door<br>
      When I said "Joe sent me" someone laughed out loud behind the green door<br> 
      All I want to do is join that happy crowd behind the green door<br>
      'cause it's midnight, one more night without sleeping
    </p>       
    <h1>FIGURE</h1>
    <p>
      Heads Square Thru and give 4 hands around you go now,<br> 
      You make Right Hands Star,<br>
      Heads Star Left, once around you know<br>
      Same two, Both hands, Single Circle now<br>
      Rear back, Star Thru and Roll<br>
      Swing the Corner, Promenade on home<br>
      <span class="lyrics">Well now, it's midnight, one more night without sleeping</span>
