    <p>
      Sides face, Grand Square<br>
      <span class="lyrics">The rain is falling lightly on the buildings and the cars<br>
      I've said good-bye to city friends department stores and bars<br>
      The lights of town are at my back my heart is full of stars<br>
      And I'm gonna be a country girl again.</span><br>
      Allemande and Weave<br>
      <span class="lyrics">I'm gonna be country girl again</span><br>
      Swing the lady round and promenade go round my friend<br>
      <span class="lyrics">I'll tell you all the lights of Broadway don't amount to an acre of green<br>
      And I'm gonna be a country girl again</span>

    <h2>Break Lyrics</h2>
    <p class="lyrics">
      I've spent my time in study   Oh, I've taken my degrees<br>
      And memorized my formulas   My As and Bs and Cs<br>
      But what I know came long ago and not from such as these<br>
      And I'm gonna be a country girl again.
    </p>
    <h2>Closer Lyrics</h2>
    <p class="lyrics">
      I've wandered through the hearts of men searching for a sign<br>
      Here I might find happiness    I might find peace of mind<br>
      But the one who taught my lessons was the soft wind through the pines<br>
      And I'm gonna be a country girl again.
    </p>
    <h1>FIGURE</h1>
    <p>
      Heads/Sides lead to the right   Gonna veer to the left you see<br>
      Couples circulate    Chain down the line for me<br>
      Pass thru do a  Wheel and Deal<br>
      The centers pass thru    Go right and left thru the outside two<br>
      Come on and square thru three hands<br> 
      The corner lady swing<br>
      Swing that lady    Promenade go round the ring<br>
      <span class="lyrics">I'll tell you all the lights of Broadway don't amount to an acre of green<br>
      And I'm gonna be a country girl again</span>
