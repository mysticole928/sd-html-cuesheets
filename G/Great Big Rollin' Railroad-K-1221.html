   Cue sheet notes: This dance is the combined efforts of several people to whom we would like to say thanks for all their efforts.  Vaughn Parrish caller and co-author of the dance, Vaughn's grandson who did the diesel horn in the background, Ross Crispino co-author of dance and author of the Grand Q figure.  Ross is from Nampa, Idaho, retired from Union Pacific Railroad.  Ross and his wife are very active in the square dance movement (Ross as a caller, and Penny as a round dance teacher and cuer).  Thanks to Mike Brenneman, square dance caller from Omaha, Nebraska who helped coordinate all of this.  Last, but not least, Mr. Edwin C. Schafer, General Director of Public Relations and Advertising, Union Pacific Railroad Co., Omaha, Nebraska who gave permission for us to record "Great Big Rollin' Railroad" as this is the Union Pacific Railroad song.  Many thanks, C.O. Guest, Kalox Records.
