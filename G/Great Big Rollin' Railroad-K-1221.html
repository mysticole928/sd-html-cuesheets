<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - ENDING</P><br><br>Sides face, grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>We're a great big rollin' railroad, one that everybody knows<br>
We were born of gold and silver spike a hundred years ago<br>
We're a thousand wheels of freight train, hear the diesel engine's power<br>
We're the Union Pacific</L></FONT><br>
4 ladies chain<br>
You chain the ladies over then turn and chain 'em back<br>
Turn the girl with an arm around, then promenade the track<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>We're a million miles of history shinin' in the sun<br>
We're the Union Pacific and our story's just begun</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>4 ladies make a ring, circle to the left from where you are<br>
Turn your partner by the left, turn your corner right, make a wrong way thar<br>
Boys to the middle with the left hand in back up you know<br>
Shoot the star, left allemande and then bow real low, weave the ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>From the green fields of the prairies to the blue Pacific shores</L></FONT><br>
Swing and whirl the pretty little doll and promenade once more<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Cross the flats at Salt Lake City on to Vegas and L.A.<br>
We're the Union Pacific *and we got the right of way</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>*Face your partner, Grand Q**<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>We're a great big rollin' railroad, one that everybody knows<br>

We're a thousand wheels of freight train, hear the diesel engine's power<br>
We're the Union Pacific doin' ninety miles an hour<br>
From the green fields of the prairies to the blue Pacific shores<br>
We deliver your great cargo and come home rollin' home for more<br>
We're a million miles of history shinin' in the sun<br>
We're the Union Pacific and our story's just begun</L></FONT><br>
