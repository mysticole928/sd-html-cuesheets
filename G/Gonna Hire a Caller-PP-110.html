<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - ENDING</P><br><br>Sides face, grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I'm gonna hire a caller to decorate our home<br>
So you will feel more at ease and won't have to roam<br>
We'll take out the recliner, put chairs along the wall<br>
Make two signs marked "His" and "Hers" for the bathrooms down the hall</L></FONT><br>
4 ladies chain, go straight across the ring<br>
You turn and chain those ladies right back home and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>We'll rip out all the carpet, run a dust mop on the floor<br>
Put out the cake and coffee and we can dance some more</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Now the head two couples square thru 4 hands around you go<br>
Make a right hand star with the sides and turn it once you know<br>
Come into the middle with a left hand star, one time you bet<br>
To the same two go right & left thru, turn 'em you're not through yet<br>
You swing thru two times, now move on down the line<br>
Swing that corner lady and promenade in time<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>The square dance fever struck us and we've driven many a mile<br>
Our poor old Chevy's had it, but it's lasted quite a while</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>4 ladies promenade inside the ring<br>
Get back home, swing your baby, everybody swing<br>
Then join hands and circle left, go movin' round the town<br>
You allemande left your corner, weave in and out you go<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>We are true blue square dancers and all our friends are, too</L></FONT><br>
You dosado your lady and promenade you do<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You'll get that friendly service and square dance atmosphere<br>
We'll listen to the same old jokes and grin or laugh right here</L></FONT><br>
