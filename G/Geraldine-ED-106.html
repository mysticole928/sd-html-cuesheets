<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>There's a girl lives down from me, she's as sexy as can be<br>
Especially when she lays out in the sun<br>
She wears hardly any clothes, she gets tan from head to toe<br>
And watchin' her turn brown, turns me on</L></FONT><br>
Allemande and weave the ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Geraldine, oh Geraldine</L></FONT><br>
Swing that girl and promenade<br>

She's the kind that likes to be admired<br>
She ran thru my flower bed, with a towel around her head<br>
And I mowed down every flower in my yard</L></FONT><br>
