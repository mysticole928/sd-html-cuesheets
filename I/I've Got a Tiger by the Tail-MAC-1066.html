<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>You allemande the corner, at home you box the gnat<br>
You pull her by and then that corner swing<br>
Join your hands and circle to the left around that town<br>
Roll away then weave around that ring<br>
It's in and out you go, meet a girl and dosado<br>
Left allemande, come back and you promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I'm as lost as a leaf in a gale<br>
And it looks like I got a tiger by the tail</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head 2 ladies chain, you turn the girls and then<br>
Same 2 go up and back, a 1/2 square thru<br>
Dosado, make an ocean wave, you rock up and back<br>
You swing thru and you go along that track, rock up and back<br>
Box the gnat, men circulate* and swing<br>
You promenade you go walking around the ring<br>
