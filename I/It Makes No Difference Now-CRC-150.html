I'll get along without you now, that's plain to see</L></FONT><br>
Left allemande, do a dosado your own<br>
The men star by the left, go once around<br>
You turn the partner by the right, and the corner allemande<br>
Swing your own and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I don't care what happens next, for I'll get by somehow<br>
I don't worry, 'cause it makes no difference now</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads square thru 4 hands around<br>
And with the sides you make a right hand star<br>
Heads star by the left a full turn and then<br>
To the same pair you do a dosado<br>
Swing thru and now the boys you trade<br>
Swing your corner lady and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Let things happen as they will and I'll get by somehow<br>
