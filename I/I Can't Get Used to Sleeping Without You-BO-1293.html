Do an allemande left that corner girl and do a dosado now<br>
Allemande that corner, weave the ring<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Well now those heads square thru 4 hands around the ring go<br>
Around that corner girl a dosado<br>
Do a curlique and then scoot back here we go<br>

Boys run and square thru 3<br>
Swing that corner, promenade<br>
