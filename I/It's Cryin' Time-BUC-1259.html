<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - BREAK</P><br><br>Sides face, grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh, it's cryin' time again you're gonna leave me<br>
I can see that far away look in your eyes<br>
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'<br>
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time</L></FONT><br>
Four ladies promenade go walkin' around now<br>
Get back home and then you swing and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'<br>
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads (sides) promenade go three-quarters<br>
While the sides (heads) do a right and left thru<br>
Pass thru - circle four and make a line now<br>
Dance up to the middle and come on back you do - touch a quarter<br>
Circulate - boys run right now<br>
Swing that girl around and promenade<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh, they say that absence make a heart grow fonder<br>
And that tears are only rain to make love grow<br>
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger<br>
If I lived to be a hundred years old</L></FONT><br>
Four ladies promenade go walkin' around now<br>
Get back home and then you swing and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And as sure as the sun come up tomorrow<br>
Cryin' time will start when you walk out</L></FONT><br>
