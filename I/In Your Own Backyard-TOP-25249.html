<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>You allemande left, then go back home dosado<br>
Now swing your corner round and round<br>
Gents star left round the set, same girl you just left<br>
Box the gnat, change hands, left allemande<br>
You weave the ring, go in and out all around the ring you go<br>
Dosado your honey bun, that's back to back you know<br>
Allemande left that corner maid, come back, promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Back to your own backyard</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Those heads square thru 5 hands around you do<br>
Sides divide, meet somebody, star thru<br>
Circle 1/2, make a two-faced line, circulate (you're doing fine)<br>
When you do wheel & deal, face those two, dive thru<br>
Substitute, then square thru 3/4 around you go<br>
Swing that corner gal around, keep her and promeno<br>
