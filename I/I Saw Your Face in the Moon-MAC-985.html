<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>Whirlaway 1/2 sashay, then weave around that ring<br>
Go in and out around the ring you go, dosado, it's back to back<br>
Corners all box the gnat, pull her by<br>
Do a dopaso, it's her by the left, new corner by the right<br>
And her by the left around, that corner lady swing<br>
Yes, you swing, swing, swing<br>
You promenade around that way, get along home, swing and sway<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 lead to the right, circle left you know<br>
Head gents break, line up 4, it's up and back you go<br>
Star thru, dosado to an ocean wave you do<br>
You rock it up and back, square thru 3, you do<br>
3/4 round, left allemande<br>
You promenade, go walkin' round that land<br>
Gents roll in a left face whirl, promenade that corner girl<br>
