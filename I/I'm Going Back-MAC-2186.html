<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Middle Break:
* I met a girl in Kansas city she ask me if I'd like to step around
** But there were things she had to fix up
So she took my 14 dollars do si do and promenade
Now she's been gone since (thursday) evening
And i have a hunch i'll never see that gal again.

Closer:
* When i grow up and have a grandson
I will tell him about those days.
** There ain't no used in my pretending
the city ain't no place to, do si do and promenade in
Going back to where i come from.
Where the mockinbird singing in the lilac bush
