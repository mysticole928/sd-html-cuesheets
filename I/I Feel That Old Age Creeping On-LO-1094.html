<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Bow to your partner, corners all<br>
Circle left go round that hall, circle left around that ring you go<br>
Break and trail single file, lady in the lead, gents run wild<br>
Girls backtrack, it's once around you go<br>
Meet your partner, box the gnat, pull her by, left allemande<br>
Come back and promenade that ring, promenade I'll tell you why<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I can't keep up with the younger guys, I feel that old age creeping on</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 lead to the right, circle 4 and hang on tight<br>
Head gents break and make a line, go up and back<br>
Pass thru and round off, do a double pass thru<br>
Centers in, cast off 3/4 round<br>
Star thru and square thru 3/4 around that track<br>
Swing that corner girl and promenade, promenade I'll tell you dear<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I'm getting too old to shift my gear, I feel that old age creeping on</L></FONT><br>
