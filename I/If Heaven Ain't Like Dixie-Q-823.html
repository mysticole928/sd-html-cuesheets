<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE: (twice for heads, twice for sides)</P><br><br>
One and three promenade half way around you go<br>
Down the center and square thru four hands around you know<br>
Go all the way around and then you circle up four half way you see<br>
Veer to the left and couples circulate one time for me<br>
Wheel and deal and pass to the center and then<br>
Square thru three quarters round, swing the corner, promenade<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I've got wild honey trees and crazy little weeds growing round my shack.<br>
These dusty roads ain't streets of gold but I'm happy right where I'm at.<br>
All these pretty little southern belles are a country boys dream<br>
They ain' got wings or halos but they're sure lookin' good to me.</L></FONT><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I was one of the chosen few to be born in Alabam<br>
I'm just like my daddy's song, I'm proud of who I am.<br>
I went thru a lot of good women and shook old Jim Beam's hand<br>
If I never see the pearly gates I've walked thru the promised land</L></FONT><br>
