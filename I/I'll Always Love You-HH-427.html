<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>All 4 ladies chain across, turn the girls don't get lost<br>
Join hands, circle left and then<br>
4 ladies roll a 1/2 sashay, circle left in the same old way<br>
Now roll away and weave around the ring<br>
It's in and out around you go, meet your own, do a dosado<br>
Left allemande, come back and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I always want you to remember that I'll always be here waiting<br>
And I'll always love you like I do</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 square thru go 4 hands in the middle you do<br>
All the way around then do a dosado<br>
Swing thru, go two by two, boys run to the right you do<br>
Bend the line, go forward up and back, slide thru<br>
A right & left thru, turn that girl, flutter wheel around the world<br>
Go full around and swing then promenade<br>
