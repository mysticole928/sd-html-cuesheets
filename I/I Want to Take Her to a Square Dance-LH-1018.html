<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>4 ladies promenade inside around that ring<br>
Well you get back home, swing your man around<br>
Join all of your hands, circle left around that land<br>
Left allemande, gonna weave around that ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I want to take her to a square dance</L></FONT><br>
Dosado and promenade for me<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I want to hold you oh, so close, dear<br>
All the boys will be wishing they were me</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Those heads square thru 4 hands around will do<br>
When you meet that corner, dosado you know<br>
Star thru and then flutter wheel across my friend<br>
Pass thru and chase right across you go<br>
Cast right 3/4, boys trade<br>
Turn thru, left allemande, come back and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Walking hand in hand as we stroll along<br>
Just thinking about the plans we made</L></FONT><br>
