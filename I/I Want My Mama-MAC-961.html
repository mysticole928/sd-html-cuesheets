<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P><br><br>Sides face, grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*It's square dance time again, the dance has just begun<br>
We'll hoop it up and dosado and have a ball of fun<br>
I want my mama dancing now to swing around with me<br>
So all get set for more to come, foot loose and fancy free</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head couples promenade go halfway with your maid<br>
A 1/2 square thru and a right & left thru<br>
Turn your girl and then, dive thru and square thru 3<br>
3/4 round and swing your corner there<br>
Allemande your corner, you weave the ring around<br>
Go in and out until you meet her again<br>
Then promenade her, you serenade her<br>
Take her home and balance out<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*We won't do the curlique, cast off nor hopp-dee-do<br>
Just the plain and simple things like mama used to do<br>
Stack the deck and twist the line just keeps her all upset<br>
When mama gets up on the floor she won't be such a wreck<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">*Mama dances like a dream when she's not shoved around</P><br><br>She's looking for a shufflin' man who keeps a steady beat<br>
Then she'll dance til' mornin' hour 'midst rain and snow and heat<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">*This will be the last go round for me to sing this song</P><br><br>Won't you tell your friends alike my tale of mama's woe<br>
So she'll dance a long, long time for years to come and go</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">TAG</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*(Substitute for last line)<br>
Take her home and balance out and swing<br>
Your swinging now with your mama there</L></FONT><br>
