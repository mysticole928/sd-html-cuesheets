<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P><br><br>Allemande left that corner girl and weave around that track<br>
When you meet your baby dosado, it's back to back<br>
Then join hands and circle left, you circle around that ring<br>
Men turn in, make a right hand star, it's once around that ring<br>
Left allemande now, grand right & left now<br>
You meet your baby and you promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I know your mind's on someone else, you're singing a new love song<br>
I won't be number two with you, I've been number one too long</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1st and 3rd you lead to the right and circle around that track<br>
Head gents break and make a line, rock forward and back and then<br>
Cross trail thru and u-turn back and star thru again<br>
Square thru 3/4 round now<br>
You swing the corner and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Your big brown eyes, they tell me lies, I know your love is gone<br>
I won't be number two with you, I've been number one too long</L></FONT><br>
