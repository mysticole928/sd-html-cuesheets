Get back home and swing your man and promenade I sing<br>

Walk right in and square thru four hands around and then<br>
Do a right and left thru and turn them with a half sashay you know<br>
Pass thru, trade by, box the gnat and go<br>
Square thru three to the corner allemande<br>
Come back one and swing and promenade the land<br>
