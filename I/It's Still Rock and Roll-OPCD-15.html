<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?<br>
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?</L></FONT><br>
Left allemande and weave that ring<br>
Rockin' round to the step of this jive<br>
Swing the girl, promenade your honey<br>

Left allemande and weave that ring<br>
Roll it on down that line<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Don't you know about the new fashion, honey?<br>
