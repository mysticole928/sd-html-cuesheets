Circle left<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">*Today I passed her on the street<BR>
And my heart fell at he feet</SPAN><BR>
The men star right and you roll it 'round the ring and go<BR>
(Do an allemande left and weave the ring)<BR>
Come on and wind in and out by her side<BR>
Dosado and promenade your bride<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Oh, I can't help it if I'm still in love with you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE (twice for heads, twice for sides)</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
The heads square thru four hands around<BR>
Dosado corner <BR>
You swing thru, the boys run right<BR>
Let the couples circulate<BR>
Move up, ferris wheel now<BR>
Double pass thru and leaders trade<BR>
You swing with the corner promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Oh, I can't help it if I'm still in love with you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">TAG</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
Do an allemande left and swing <BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Oh, I can't help it if I'm still in love with you</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">*Somebody else was by her side<BR>
And she looked so satisfied</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">*He walked along so close to you<BR>
Oh, Just the way I used to do</SPAN>
