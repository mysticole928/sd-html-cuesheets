<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>And now those 4 ladies chain, you'll turn that pretty Jane<br>
You chain that lady right back home again<br>
Then join those hands and form a ring, you circle left I sing<br>
Left allemande and weave the ring I say<br>
Well it's in and out you go until you meet your own<br>
Dosado that lady then you promenade her home<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Honey my love was true, but you've made me blue<br>
So I'll get along without you now</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head couples promenade you know, halfway round the ring you go<br>
Star thru, pass thru, swing thru those two<br>
You balance there and then, swing thru again<br>
You'll balance then you'll double spin the top<br>
Well now you're moving to that corner, that corner swing<br>
Oh you swing that lady round and then you promenade that ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Honey one of us was true, and baby it wasn't you<br>
So I'll just get along without you now</L></FONT><br>
