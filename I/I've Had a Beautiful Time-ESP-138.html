<br><br>Side Face Grand Square<br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
We met downtown in a bar room<br>
Both of us needing a friend<br>
You brought me home to your doorstep<br>
It was there, you invited me in</L></FONT><br>
Allemande left and Weave <br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
We spent the wee hours, dancing</L></FONT><br>
You dosado and promenade<br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
We talked about what we'd been needing<br>
Discussing our ups and our downs</L>

FIGURE</P><br><br>
Those heads square thru 4 hands around you go<br>
Around your corner you dosado<br>
You swing thru and then, hey boys run to the right<br>
Chain down the line, is what you do<br>
Come on and slide thru, touch 1/4, scoot back<br>
You swing that girl and promenade<br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
I poured out my feelings while you poured the wine<br>
and I've had a beautiful time</L></FONT>

Middle Break</P>

<br><br>Side Face Grand Square<br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
If I seem a wee bit uneasy<br>
You really sized me up right<br>
There's somebody home still up waiting<br>
She's probably been waiting up all night</L></FONT><br>
Allemande left and Weave <br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
I can't say I found any answers<br>
But you listened while I rattled on<br>
And you've been a beautiful lady<br>
And you kept me from being alone</L></FONT>

Ending</P>

<br><br>Side Face Grand Square<br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
And I've had a beautiful time<br>
Holdin' your body next to mine<br>
You poured out your feelings and I poured the wine<br>
And I've had a beautiful time</L></FONT><br>
Allemande left and Weave<br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
And I've had a beautiful time<br>
Holdin' your heart next to mine<br>
And you've been a beautiful lady<br>
and I've had a beautiful time</L></FONT>
