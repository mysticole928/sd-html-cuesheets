<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - BREAK</P><br><br>Bow to your partners, corners too<br>
Circle to the left, that's what you do<br>
Circle left with your baby, reverse now, go single file<br>
Girls step out, back track awhile<br>
Box the gnat, pull her by, your corner allemande<br>
Come back one and dosado, once around that maid<br>
Swing and whirl that same little girl<br>
And give a little twirl and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I don't care if the sun don't shine<br>
I'll get my swingin' in the evening time<br>
When I'm with my baby</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 a right & left thru, turn the girls, here's what you do<br>
Opposite lady right hand round, partner by the left<br>
New corners all a right & left thru, turn the girls like you ought to do<br>
Dive thru, square thru 5 hands round you run<br>
Count to 5 and don't be late, swing that corner one<br>
Swing that corner once or twice and promenade, get on the run<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>'Cause I don't care if the sun don't shine<br>
I'll get my lovin' in the evening time<br>
When I'm with my baby</L></FONT><br>
