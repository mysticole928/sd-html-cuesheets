<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE (four times through)</P><br><br>The head two couples bow and swing, the side two ladies chain<br>
The heads go forward up and back with you<br>
Then a right & left thru and turn your girl and cross trail thru<br>
Around just one you line up four, go up and back<br>
Pass thru and bend the line, go up and back<br>
Pass thru, and then you wheel & deal, face your own<br>
Now back away and make a ring and circle 8<br>
You circle to the left and to the right<br>
And now the gents square thru, go full around<br>
Go all the way and swing that lady there<br>
And now the girls star left go once around<br>
You box the gnat and then you promenade<br>
The heads wheel around and do a right & left thru<br>
Then cross trail back and allemande left you do<br>
Promenade your partner and go full around<br>
