<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>If I keep on going crazy, I'll get there by and by<br>
It's the only place that I can go to get you off my mind</L></FONT><br>
Left allemande that corner, come back a dosado<br>
Left allemande and weave the ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh when you left me darling, I nearly lost my mind</L></FONT><br>
Swing that girl around and promenade one time<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And getting there's so easy, I didn't even have to try<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head couples square thru 4 hands around for me<br>
Do a dosado go all the way around with the corner girl<br>
Well now you swing thru and boys run to the right<br>
You bend the line, up and back, pass thru<br>
With a wheel & deal, do a double pass thru and track 2<br>
Swing that corner girl and promenade you do<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And getting there's so easy, I didn't even have to try<br>
If I keep on going crazy, I'll get there by and by</L></FONT><br>
