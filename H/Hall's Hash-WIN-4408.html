    Well, honor your partner, and honor your corner
    <br/>
    And first and third go forward and back, then star by the right on the inside track
    <br/>
    And turn your corner with a left hand swing and box the gnat in the middle of the ring
    <br/>
    Pass right back to the sides of the town, with a dosado go full around
    <br/>
    Like an ocean wave you hang on tight, go forward and back, then swing by the right
    <br/>
    Same couple star with the old left wing, to the opposite shore with a right hand swing
    <br/>
    Back to the middle and box the flea, pass right back to the sides of the sea
    <br/>
    See saw round 'em, all the way around, and you make that wave as you come down
    <br/>
    Go forward and back and swing by the left, same couples star in center of the set
    <br/>
    Turn your corner with a left elbow, it's partners all with a dosado
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Now two and four do a half sashay, go up to the middle and back that way
    <br/>
    Take the opposite lady and box the gnat, come right &amp; left thru the other way back
    <br/>
    Turn right back and pass right thru, you split that ring and around just two
    <br/>
    And by your corners stand
    <br/>
    Forward eight and eight fall back, go forward again and box the gnat
    <br/>
    Come right &amp; left thru the other way back
    <br/>
    Then turn right back and pass right thru, and then you stop!
    <br/>
    Swing the gal behind you, pop!
    <br/>
    Now the center couples you form a ring, and circle half with the dear little thing
    <br/>
    Sashay by your partners two, re-sashay then a right &amp; left thru
    <br/>
    And turn 'em around like you always do, and swing that gal in front of you
    <br/>
    Swing her on out to the edge of the ring, and all join hands and form a ring
    <br/>
    Walk all around that ol' left hand lady, see saw round your pretty little baby

    Now allemande left and allemande thar, go right &amp; left and form a star
    <br/>
    You back 'em up, boys, but not too far
    <br/>
    The gents wheel out, the ladies star, turn the opposite gent from where you are
    <br/>
    Go once and a half and the gents star in, turn the opposite lady with a left hand spin
    <br/>
    A right to the corner like a wrong way thar, back 'em, boys, in a left hand star
    <br/>
    You throw out the clutch and put 'er in low, it's twice around that ring you go
    <br/>
    Skip that gal as you come down and turn the next with the right hand around
    <br/>
    And the right hand lady with the left hand around, partner right with a full turn around
    <br/>
    A left to the corner like an allemande thar, you back 'em up, boys, in a right hand star
    <br/>
    Shoot this star with a full turn around, turn the left hand lady with the right hand round

    Do an allemande left and a right to your dears, it's a wagon wheel but strip those gears
    <br/>
    You catch her by the left with a dopaso, it's corners right and around you go
    <br/>
    Then a left hand round your pretty little maid, the ladies star, the gents promenade
    <br/>
    Go twice around to your pretty little girl, then shoot that star with a left hand whirl
    <br/>
    It's once and a half and the gents star in, the girls run around on the outside rim
    <br/>
    Wave to your gal, we're off to the races, pass her again and then trade places
    <br/>
    Gents step out and the girls star in, go twice around 'til you meet her again
    <br/>
    Now box the gnat and the gents star back, the gals run around on the outside track
    <br/>
    It's twice around to your pretty little date, shoot that star with a catch all eight
    <br/>
    By the right hand half, back by the left hand all the way around
    <br/>
    And promenade the corner as she comes down
    <br/>
    Yes, promenade, and you walk with pride, you've got mamma by your side
    <br/>
    Now honor your partner, corners all, and you wave to the gal across the hall
    <br/>
    Do an allemande left, don't go too far, and bow to your honey and there you are!
