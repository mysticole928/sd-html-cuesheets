      He said I'll love you 'til I die, she told him you'll forget in time
      <br>
      As the years went slowly by, she still preyed upon his mind
      <br>
      He kept her picture on his wall, went half crazy now and then
      <br>
      He still loved her through it all, hoping she'd come back again
      <br>
      <br>
      Kept some letters by his bed, dated in nineteen sixty two
      <br>
      He had underlined in red, every single I love you
      <br>
      I went to see him just today, oh but I didn't see no tears
      <br>
      All dressed up to go away, first time I'd seen him smile in years
      <br>
      <br>
      He stopped loving her today, they placed a wreath upon his door
      <br>
      Soon they'll carry him away, he stopped loving her today
      <br>
      <br>
      You know she came to see him one last time
      <br>
      Ah, we all wondered if she would
      <br>
      And it kept runnin' through my mind
      <br>
      This time, he's over her for good
      <br>
      <br>
      He stopped loving her today, they placed a wreath upon his door
      <br>
      Soon they'll carry him away, he stopped loving her today
