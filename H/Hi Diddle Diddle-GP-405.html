     Old King Cole was a merry old soul

     And a merry old soul was he
     <br/>
     He called for his pie and he called for his bowl
     <br/>
     And he called for a storybook tea
     <br/>
     Porridge cold, Porridge hot
     <br/>
     He chased the mouse right up the clock
     <br/>
     It was a rowdy crowd and it got real loud

     Hi diddle, diddle it's a cat and a fiddle

     Humpty Dumpty came to the ball
     <br/>
     But he drank too much and had a great fall

     All for the girl who had a little curl
     <br/>
     And she made a mess of Humpty's world

     Old Jack Spratt could eat no fat

     His wife could eat no lean

     Jack and Jill ran up the hill
     <br/>
     To fetch a pail of water
     <br/>
     Jack fell down and broke his crown
     <br/>
     And Jill was soon to follow
     <br/>
     But Jack was nimble and Jack was quick
     <br/>
     And he played the drums with a candlestick
     <br/>
     Everybody came from miles around

     When they dig that storybook sound
