<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Old King Cole was a merry old soul<br>
And a merry old soul was he<br>
He called for his pie and he called for his bowl<br>
And he called for a storybook tea<br>
Porridge cold, Porridge hot<br>
He chased the mouse right up the clock<br>
It was a rowdy crowd and it got real loud</L></FONT><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Hi diddle, diddle it's a cat and a fiddle<br>
And a cow jumped over the moon<br>
Little boy blue and the woman in the shoe<br>
And the cup ran away with the spoon<br>
Hi diddle, diddle it's a cat and a fiddle<br>
And they played it all night long<br>
They all drank beer and everybody cheered<br>
When they heard that storybook song</L></FONT><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Humpty Dumpty came to the ball<br>
But he drank too much and had a great fall<br>
All for the girl who had a little curl<br>
And she made a mess of Humpty's world<br>
Old Jack Spratt could eat no fat<br>
His wife could eat no lean<br>
So between the two of them<br>
They licked the platter clean</L></FONT><br>

Jack fell down and broke his crown<br>
And Jill was soon to follow<br>
But Jack was nimble and Jack was quick<br>
And he played the drums with a candlestick<br>
Everybody came from miles around<br>
When they dig that storybook sound</L></FONT><br>
