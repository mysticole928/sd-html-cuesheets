<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Woah Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean, <br>
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen. <br>
I guess if you said so <br>
I'd have to pack my things and go. (That's right)<br>
 <br>
Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way <br>
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day. <br>
(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood) <br>
(you ain't got no money you just ain't no good.) <br>
Well, I guess if you say so <br>
I'd have to pack my things and go. (That's right) <br>
