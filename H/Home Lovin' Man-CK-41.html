<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*The harbor lights were shining, the moon was in its high<br>
The captain said, that God we're home, we've drunk the barrel dry<br>
The mizzen mast was shaky, and the lanterns all burned low<br>
I never thought we'd make it, but we've 20 leagues to go</L></FONT><br>
<C>Four ladies promenade</C> now, <C>once around</C> you go<br>
<C>Swing</C> your own and <C>promenade</C>, <C>once around</C> the floor<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I know I'm gonna miss the sand in my hand<br>
The roll of the tide and the song in the air<br>
Deep inside it's true<br>
I'm a home lovin' man and I'm comin' on home to you</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>The <C>head two couples</C> <C>pass thru</C>, do a <C>u-turn back</C> in time<br>
Do a <C>curlique</C> in front of you and <C>make a right hand star</C> and go<br>
<C>Heads</C> <C>star by the left</C> in the middle, <C>once around</C> will do<br>
To the same outside pair, you do the <C>right & left thru</C><br>
<C>Swing thru</C> and the <C>boys run</C>, do a <C>half tag the line</C><br>
<C>Swing</C> that corner there and <C>promenade</C> in time<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I know I'm gonna miss the wind in my eyes<br>
The shimmer of light where the seagulls fly<br>
Though I've traveled far<br>
I'm a home lovin' man and home is where you are</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE FIGURE</P><br><br>The <C>head two couples</C> <C>square thru 4</C> hands around you go<br>
And with the outside couple there, a <C>right & left thru</C> you know<br>
<C>Swing thru</C> and then, <C>boys run right</C><br>
<C>Ladies hinge</C>, <C>diamond circulate</C> tonight<br>
<C>Flip your diamond</C> and <C>recycle</C> round you go<br>
<C>Swing the corner</C> lady and <C>promenade</C> the ring<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*The crowd upon the quaysound, their faces long and drawn<br>
Were suddenly awakened as we sailed in on the dawn<br>
The wives, the sons and lovers, who never gave up hope<br>
All breathed a sigh together as they reached to catch the rope</L></FONT><br>
