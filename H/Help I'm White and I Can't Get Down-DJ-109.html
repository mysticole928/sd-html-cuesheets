<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*My woman told me last Friday night<br>

Her birthday's comin' and things ain't right<br>

We've been together since before the war<br>

And I've never had her out on the dance hall floor<br>

Didn't know what to say<br>

I never learned to dance, only learned to play<br>

And to watch other people gonna do their thing<br>

My job was to pick and sing</L></FONT><br>

<C>Four ladies gonna chain</C> the ring<br>

You gonna turn and <C>chain those ladies</C><br>

Right on back around you go<br>

Gonna take that girl and you <C>promenade</C><br>

Get a walkin' around the ring I say<br>

When you get back home and when you get there<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br><C>Heads</C> you <C>square thru</C> get four now<br>

'Round the corner <C>dosado</C> now<br>

<C>Swing thru</C> and then the <C>boy run</C> to the right<br>

<C>Bend the line</C> and a <C>right & left thru</C><br>

<C>Flutter wheel</C> across the dance floor<br>

<C>Slide thru</C>, <C>swing the corner</C> and you <C>promenade</C> her<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I need some help when I do the town<br>

Help! I'm white and I can't get down</L></FONT><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Well, I moped around the house<br>

I watched TV and slept on the couch<br>

Flipped through the dial and after a while<br>

A commercial came on that made me smile<br>

Said learn to dance, learn to move<br>

Call one-nine-hundred, you just can't lose<br>

Well, it didn't take me long<br>

I jumped right up and ran to the phone><br><br>



*Well, I took the course and I learn quick<br>So when that magic evening came<br>

I knew I wouldn't be ashamed<br>

The floor was crowded, but something's wrong<br>

I didn't recognize these songs<br>

These cowboys ain't on my video tape<br>

There must be some mistake</L></FONT><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">TAG</P><br><br>You face your corner there<br>

<C>Allemande left</C> with the corner girl<br>

Do a <C>dosado</C> get around your own<br>

You're gonna turn to the corner<br>

And you <C>bow</C> real low...you did 'er good y'all<br>
