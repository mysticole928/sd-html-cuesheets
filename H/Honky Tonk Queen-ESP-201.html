     I went inside and she was sitting there
     <br>
     With lovely makeup and beautiful hair
     <br>
     So I asked that gal to dance
     <br>
     He tried his best to really stress
     <br>
     That girl didn't look right in that dress
     <br>
     But I never heard a song

    <span class="lyrics">
     As we danced I took her hand
     <br>
     Spun her around and pulled her in
     <br>
     Then I spun her a little too hard
     <br>
     I wondered when she said her name was Bill
     <br>
     And her wig fell off and I was ready to kill
     <br>
     That joker dressed up just like a female
