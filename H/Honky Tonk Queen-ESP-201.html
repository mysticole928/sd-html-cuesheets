     I went inside and she was sitting there
     <br/>
     With lovely makeup and beautiful hair
     <br/>
     So I asked that gal to dance
     <br/>

     <br/>
     But I never heard a song

     Spun her around and pulled her in
     <br/>
     Then I spun her a little too hard
     <br/>
     I wondered when she said her name was Bill
     <br/>
     And her wig fell off and I was ready to kill
     <br/>
     That joker dressed up just like a female
