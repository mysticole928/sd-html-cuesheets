      I went inside and she was sitting there
      <br>
      With lovely makeup and beautiful hair
      <br>
      So I asked that gal to dance
      <br>
      He tried his best to really stress
      <br>
      That girl didn't look right in that dress
      <br>
      But I never heard a song
     </span>
     <br>
     <br>
     <span class="lyrics">
      As we danced I took her hand
      <br>
      Spun her around and pulled her in
      <br>
      Then I spun her a little too hard
      <br>
      I wondered when she said her name was Bill
      <br>
      And her wig fell off and I was ready to kill
      <br>
      That joker dressed up just like a female
