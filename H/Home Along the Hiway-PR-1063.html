<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She was standing by the highway, I was trucking on down the road<br>
I was moving freight to Denver, she looked so wet and cold<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well, she said she lived in Denver, she was going back home again<br>
She's been chasing around the country with some Colorado friends<br>
We talked the night away it seemed & when we hit the Utah line<br>
