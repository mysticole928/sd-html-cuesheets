<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Join hands and circle to the left go round the ring now<br>
Reverse trail, walk in single file<br>
Girls back track and then when you meet 'em turn thru there<br>
Left allemande the corner, weave the ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You promised that you would love me and always be true</L></FONT><br>
Swing the partner round and round, and promenade 'em too<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I traded a lifetime of joy for a few careless moments<br>
That you were just wasting that day</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Those head 2 you square thru 4 hands around that ring now<br>
With the corner lady do a dosado<br>
Slide thru then pass thru, do a partner trade and then<br>
Reverse the flutter wheel across the ring you go<br>
Ladies lead, do a dixie style to an ocean wave<br>
Trade the wave, boys run right around one girl, now promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I traded a heart full of love for a handful of kisses<br>
That you were just throwing away</L></FONT><br>
