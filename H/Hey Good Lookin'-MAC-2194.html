<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Hey good lookin', what you got cookin'?<br>
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?<br>
Hey sweet baby, don't you think maybe<br>
We could find us a brand new recipe<br>
I got a hot rod Ford and a two-dollar bill<br>
And I know a place right over the hill<br>
Where the caller's great, just wait and see<br>
If you want to have fun come along with me, singing<br>
Hey good lookin', what you got cookin'?<br>
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head 2 couples right & left thru, turn the little girl<br>
Star thru, pass thru, do a little dosado<br>
Swing thru 2 by 2, boys run right you know<br>
1/2 tag, trade, roll, dive thru<br>
Go square thru 3/4 round, that corner lady swing one time<br>
Everybody promenade that ring, singing<br>
