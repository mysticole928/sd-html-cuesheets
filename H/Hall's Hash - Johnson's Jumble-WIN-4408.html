     Well, honor your partner, and honor your corner
     <br>
     And first and third go forward and back, then star by the right on the inside track
     <br>
     And turn your corner with a left hand swing and box the gnat in the middle of the ring
     <br>
     Pass right back to the sides of the town, with a dosado go full around
     <br>
     Like an ocean wave you hang on tight, go forward and back, then swing by the right
     <br>
     Same couple star with the old left wing, to the opposite shore with a right hand swing
     <br>
     Back to the middle and box the flea, pass right back to the sides of the sea
     <br>
     See saw round 'em, all the way around, and you make that wave as you come down
     <br>
     Go forward and back and swing by the left, same couples star in center of the set
     <br>
     Turn your corner with a left elbow, it's partners all with a dosado

     Now two and four do a half sashay, go up to the middle and back that way
     <br>
     Take the opposite lady and box the gnat, come right &amp; left thru the other way back
     <br>
     Turn right back and pass right thru, you split that ring and around just two
     <br>
     And by your corners stand
     <br>
     Forward eight and eight fall back, go forward again and box the gnat
     <br>
     Come right &amp; left thru the other way back
     <br>
     Then turn right back and pass right thru, and then you stop!
     <br>
     Swing the gal behind you, pop!
     <br>
     Now the center couples you form a ring, and circle half with the dear little thing
     <br>
     Sashay by your partners two, re-sashay then a right &amp; left thru
     <br>
     And turn 'em around like you always do, and swing that gal in front of you
     <br>
     Swing her on out to the edge of the ring, and all join hands and form a ring
     <br>
     Walk all around that ol' left hand lady, see saw round your pretty little baby

     Now allemande left and allemande thar, go right &amp; left and form a star
     <br>
     You back 'em up, boys, but not too far
     <br>
     The gents wheel out, the ladies star, turn the opposite gent from where you are
     <br>
     Go once and a half and the gents star in, turn the opposite lady with a left hand spin
     <br>
     A right to the corner like a wrong way thar, back 'em, boys, in a left hand star
     <br>
     You throw out the clutch and put 'er in low, it's twice around that ring you go
     <br>
     Skip that gal as you come down and turn the next with the right hand around
     <br>
     And the right hand lady with the left hand around, partner right with a full turn around
     <br>
     A left to the corner like an allemande thar, you back 'em up, boys, in a right hand star
     <br>
     Shoot this star with a full turn around, turn the left hand lady with the right hand round

     Do an allemande left and a right to your dears, it's a wagon wheel but strip those gears
     <br>
     You catch her by the left with a dopaso, it's corners right and around you go
     <br>
     Then a left hand round your pretty little maid, the ladies star, the gents promenade
     <br>
     Go twice around to your pretty little girl, then shoot that star with a left hand whirl
     <br>
     It's once and a half and the gents star in, the girls run around on the outside rim
     <br>
     Wave to your gal, we're off to the races, pass her again and then trade places
     <br>
     Gents step out and the girls star in, go twice around 'til you meet her again
     <br>
     Now box the gnat and the gents star back, the gals run around on the outside track
     <br>
     It's twice around to your pretty little date, shoot that star with a catch all eight
     <br>
     By the right hand half, back by the left hand all the way around
     <br>
     And promenade the corner as she comes down
     <br>
     Yes, promenade, and you walk with pride, you've got mamma by your side
     <br>
     Now honor your partner, corners all, and you wave to the gal across the hall
     <br>
     Do an allemande left, don't go too far, and bow to your honey and there you are!
