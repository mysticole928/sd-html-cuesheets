<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P><br><br>Four ladies promenade, walkin' once around that ring<br>
Run on back and swing there with your man<br>
Join hands and circle left, walkin' round the ring he said<br>
Left allemande with the corner and weave the ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Hold whatcha got, I'm comin' home baby<br>Hold whatcha got and I don't mean maybe</L></FONT><br>
Swing your girl and all will promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Don't sell the house, don't wreck the car<br>
Just stay there baby, right where you are<br>
If you hold whatcha got, I'm comin' home to stay</L></FONT><br><br>

Head couples promenade, walk halfway round with your maid<br>
Down the middle and here's a full square thru<br>
Go all the way and when you're there<br>
You get a right & left thru that outside pair<br>
Veer left and here's a ferris wheel<br>
Square thru and pull out three<br>
Corner girl you're gonna swing for me<br>
Take her by the hand, all promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Don't sell the house, don't wreck the car<br>
Just stay there baby, right where you are<br>

Sides face, grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>In my mind I can see it's a pretty good sign that I need ya<br>
That's why I can't wait to get back home<br>
So squeeze yourself real good and tight and I'll be there before daylight<br>
Hold whatcha got, I'm comin' home to stay</L></FONT><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>When I get back, honey I ain't leavin'<br>
Been a little too lonely, a little too much grievin'<br>
When I get back homey this time I'm gonna stay<br>

This time things are gonna be all right<br>
If you hold whatcha got, I'm comin' home to stay</L></FONT><br>
