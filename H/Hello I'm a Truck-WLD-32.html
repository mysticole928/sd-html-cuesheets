<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You've heard stories about truck drivers<br>
Many times their stories told<br>
How they pulled out of Pittsburgh<br>
For six days on the road</L></FONT><br>
Men star right, go once around and I think that's just fine<br>
Left allemande and while you weave<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I'd like to tell you mine<br>
There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks<br>
No double clutchin', partner swingin', coffee drinkin' nuts</L></FONT><br>
Promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>They'd drive their way to glory and they'd have all the luck<br>
There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks</L></FONT><br>

Around that corner lady, let's do the dosado<br>
Swing thru go two by two and then the boys run right<br>
Let's do a ferris wheel, double pass thru here tonight<br>
Track 2, go round the land, that corner lady swing<br>
Left allemande new corner and promenade the ring<br>

Around that corner lady, let's do the dosado<br>
Swing thru go two by two and then the boys run right<br>
Couples circulate and then you'll wheel & deal<br>
Pass thru, trade by, that corner lady swing<br>
Left allemande new corner and promenade the ring<br>

Drinkin' coffee and flirtin' with that waitress.<br>
Where did he leave me?<br>
Parked next to a cattle truck.<br>
Why couldn't he have put me over by the pink Mack?<br>
Boy, she's got cut mud flaps.<br>
Talk about stacked, both of her bumpers are chromed...</L></FONT><br>
