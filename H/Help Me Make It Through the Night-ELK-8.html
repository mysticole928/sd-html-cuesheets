Take the ribbon from your hair<br><br>Lay it soft against your skin<br>Like a shadow on the wall<br>Come and lay down by my side<br><br>All I'm taking is your time<br>Help me make it through the night<br>I don't care what's right or wrong<br><br>Let the devil take tomorrow<br>For tonight I need a friend<br>Yesterday is dead and gone<br><br>It's so sad to be alone<br>Help me make it through the night<br>I don't care what's right or wrong<br><br>Let the devil take tomorrow<br>For tonight I need a friend<br>Yesterday is dead and gone<br><br>It's so sad to be alone<br>Help me make it through the night<br><br>I don't want to be alone<br>Help me make it through the night
