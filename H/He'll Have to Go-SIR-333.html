</SPAN>The men star right, turn it, one tine around you know<SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><BR>
</SPAN>Allemande left and weave the ring<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">I'll ask the man to turn the jukebox way down low</SPAN><BR>
You swing and Promenade<BR>

<BR>
The heads promenade you go halfway round<BR>
Walk in star thru, pass thru, pass the ocean<BR>
Recycle then - boys walk, girls dodge<BR>
Scoot back - single hinge - boys trade<BR>

Swing your corner and you  promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And you can tell your friend there with you - he'll have to go</SPAN></P>
