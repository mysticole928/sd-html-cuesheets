   Notes:

1. The original Flag verse said "And if I had a Flag I'd let my flag out" which was changed because it did not sound right and may be mistaken for a slur.

2. The original did not mention "Bell" but was put in for balance. 

3. The original they sometimes used "me" instead of "my" as in "But since I left me Cannon at home" - feel free to use it too if you want to give it a more old English sound.
