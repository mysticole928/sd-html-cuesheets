And I asked her if she wanted to dance</SPAN><BR>
The men star right go once around the ring tonight<BR>
Left allemande and weave the ring<BR>

Swing your girl around and promenade her so right<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And all the stars were shining bright and then I kissed her</SPAN></P>

Heads promenade and go halfway 'round the ring you know<BR>
(Pass the ocean - extend)<BR>
Spin the top, girl walk up<BR>
Boys run to the right forever more (Couple hinge)<BR>
Tag your line<BR>
Cloverleaf and then, let's see the girls turn thru<BR>
Star thru and promenade her too<BR>
