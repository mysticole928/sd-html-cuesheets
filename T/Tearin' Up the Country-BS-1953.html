<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh mama and poppa told me, son you've got to go to school<br>
It's the only way to make the family proud<br>
Then all 4 ladies chain, you turn her left around<br>
Then chain that lady back across that town<br>
Why don't you walk around that corner lady, see saw your own<br>
Left allemande then promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I paid no attention, I left my books at home<br>
Now I'm tearin' up the country with a song</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Those head 2 you square thru 4 hands around will do<br>
And with the outside 2 you curlique, walk & dodge<br>
And when you're through do a partner trade and a right & left thru and then<br>
Flutter wheel go straight across that land<br>
Why don't you slide thru, left allemande, do a dosado that maid<br>
Star thru with the corner, promenade<br>
