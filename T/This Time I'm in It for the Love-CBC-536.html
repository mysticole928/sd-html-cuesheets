<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Heads in, grand parade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well you could say I've had my share of lovers<br>
But there were others before your time<br>
But I know now that I was only looking<br>
Looking for something I couldn't find<br>
Until you came along, my heart was breaking<br>
Oh, it's the aching I was guilty of<br>
I've shed a bed of tears, 'cause I was lonely<br>
This time I'm in it for the love</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Those heads square thru and get me 4 hands<br>
Around the corner do a dosado<br>
Curlique and then, scoot back out there my friend<br>
Cast off 3/4 round you go, boys trade<br>
Boys run to the right and ferris wheel there<br>
Centers pass thru and swing that corner girl, promenade<br>
