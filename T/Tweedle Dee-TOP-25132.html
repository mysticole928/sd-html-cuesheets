Allemande left, let's do that grand old right & left<br>
Jimminy cricket, jimminy jack, when you meet your partner, box the gnat<br>
Grand right & left, go the other way back<br>
Next time you meet your honey, swing<br>
Just the men star left around that ring<br>
You take her along with the arm around<br>
It's a star promenade, you're going down, down, down, down<br>
Ladies backtrack, go twice around<br>
Second time you meet him, turn by the right hand half way around<br>
Now back by the left, go all the way around<br>
Take your corner and promenade down<br>
