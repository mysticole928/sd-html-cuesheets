<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>4 ladies chain across the ring now<br>
You circle to the left around you do<br>
Ladies in the men sashay, and then you circle<br>
Ladies in the men sashay, and circle left<br>
Allemande left that corner girl, then you weave around the ring<br>
Meet that girl and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Talk back trembling lips, shakey legs don't just stand there<br>
Heart don't let her know that you're breaking in two</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head couples promenade go halfway<br>
Now lead to the right and circle to a line<br>
You pass thru with a wheel & deal, and then zoom<br>
In the middle do a dosado and go one time<br>
Swing thru and then, turn thru my friend<br>
Swing that corner, promenade<br>
