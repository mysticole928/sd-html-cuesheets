<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Allemande left your corner, turn your partner by the right<br>
Men star left in the middle of the ring, go once around tonight<br>
Home you go with a dosado, go all around that Jane<br>
Box the gnat, pull her by, now the corner swing<br>
Allemande left new corner, walk by the one you swung<br>
Swing your own little lady round and promenade her home<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I've played around and played around in this old square too long<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 go up and back, then go right & left thru<br>
Square thru 3, you do 3/4 round with you<br>
U-turn back, star thru, then go right & left thru<br>
Cross trail thru, u-turn back and swing<br>
The 4 ladies promenade, go once around that ring<br>
That same man you swing now, promenade that Jane<br>
