<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*In a little cabaret in south Texas border town<br>

Sat a boy and his guitar and the people came from all around<br>

And all the girls from there to Austin<br>

Were slipping away from home and puttin jewelry in hawk</L></FONT><br>

<C>Send her right back home</C>, <C>keep her</C>, and all <C>promenade</C><br>

But give him his guitar and he'd be happy all the time<br>

And all the girls from nine to ninety<br>

Were snapping fingers, tapping toes and begging him don't stop<br><br>

*Then one day he was gone and no one ever saw him round<br>And all the girls still dream about him<br>

And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked</L></FONT><br>
