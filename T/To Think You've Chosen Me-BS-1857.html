<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE (4 times through)</P><br><br>The head 2 couples promenade halfway around<br>
Come down the middle and do a dosado<br>
Square thru and count to 4, 4 hands around<br>
And dosado the outside 2 you know, make a wave<br>
A double swing thru along the line now<br>
When you're through go right & left thru, dive thru<br>
You substitute and now you star thru<br>
Square thru 4 hands around will do<br>
Why don't you swing that corner girl and do a left allemande<br>
Then dosado and promenade her home<br>
