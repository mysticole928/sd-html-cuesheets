<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P><br><br><C>Sides face, grand square</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>This guitar only sings the way I play it<br>
It's part of me just like another arm<br>
It started out as a little ukelele<br>
When I was just a boy on the farm</L></FONT><br>
<C>Allemande</C> and <C>weave</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>My fingers were too lazy for piano<br>
But I could hold a tune pretty good<br>
And I couldn't sing a song with a trombone<br>
So I taught myself to play this piece of wood</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br><C>Head two couples</C> <C>square thru</C>, <C>sides</C> <C>roll away</C><br>
Meet that one and do a <C>dosado</C><br>
<C>Swing thru</C> and then, <C>boys run to the right</C><br>
Do a <C>right & left thru</C>, turn the girls and then <C>pass thru</C><br>
<C>Wheel & deal</C> and now, <C>centers</C> <C>square thru go 3</C><br>
<C>Swing</C> with the corner, <C>promenade</C><br>

Before I'd ever lose you again</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br><C>Four ladies promenade go inside</C><br>
Get back home and <C>swing</C> with your man<br>
<C>Join hands</C>, <C>circle to the left</C> around and then<br>
Do an <C>allemande left</C> and <C>weave</C> around the land<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>But I know you are staying beside me<br>
True lovers we both feel the pain<br>
And I'd throw this old box on the fire<br>
Before I'd ever lose you again</L></FONT><br>

<C>Sides</C> <C>lead to the right</C> and <C>circle to a line</C><br>
Move <C>up to the middle and back</C> and then <C>square thru</C><br>
4 hands around and then <C>trade by</C><br>
<C>Swing thru</C> the outside two and the <C>boys run to the right</C><br>
<C>Tag the line</C>, <C>face left</C> and <C>promenade</C><br>

One day, I'll write a song for you darlin'<br>
That'll be the very best that I can do</L></FONT><br>
<C>Allemande</C> and <C>weave</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Will it be a song about a wild me<br>
With thunderclap and flashes of blue<br>
Or will it be a song about an angel<br>
It'll never be as beautiful as you</L></FONT><br>
