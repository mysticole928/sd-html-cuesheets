<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>They're creepy and they're spooky, mysterious and kooky<br>
They're all together ooky, the Adams family<br>
Their house is a museum, when people come to see 'em<br>
They really are a screa-em, the Adams family</L></FONT><br>
4 ladies chain, chain them back, promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>So gather with your shawl on, a rouse that you can fall on<br>
We're gonna pay a call on the Adams family</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads you promenade halfway around and now<br>
Walk in and square thru <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>and talk to Mr. Ed</L></FONT><br>
Swing thru with the outside 2<br>
Boys run to the right and ferris wheel and go<br>
Square thru now 3 hands around that ring<br>
Swing Mr. Ed and promenade I sing<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>A horse is a horse, of course, of course<br>
And no one can talk to a horse, of course<br>
That is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mr. Ed</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CLOSER</P><br><br>4 Lucy's chain straight across that ring<br>
Chain her right back home and turn her, Desi<br>
Join your hands and circle left around and now<br>
Left allemande and you weave that ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Lucy kisses like no one can</L></FONT><br>
Swing your lady, promenade again<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And I'm in heaven you see<br>
For I love Lucy, yes I love Lucy, and Lucy loves me</L></FONT><br>
