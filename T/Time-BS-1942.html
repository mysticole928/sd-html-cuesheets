<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>All join hands and make a ring, circle left around I sing<br>
Reverse single file around you go<br>
Girls back track around that town, turn partner right hand around<br>
Allemande left and weave the ring you know<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I don't like the things you've done<br>
You've chased the darkness with the sun</L></FONT><br>
Dosado and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You took my father's strength away<br>
You turned my mother's hair to gray<br>
You sure do your thing, now don't you, Time</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 square thru 4 hands around you go<br>
When you meet that corner curlique<br>
Cast off 3/4 round, ladies trade, swing thru<br>
Boys run right around that girl, bend the line<br>
Slide thru and swing the corner lady round and round<br>
Left allemande and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You never seem to miss, you placed on my your Judas kiss<br>
There's no way around you, is there, Time</L></FONT><br>
