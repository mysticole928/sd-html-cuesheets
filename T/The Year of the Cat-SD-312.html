<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO</P><br><br>Sides face grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>On a morning from a Bogart movie<br>
In a country where they turn back time<br>
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre<br>
Contemplating a crime</L></FONT><br>
Allemande left and weave<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She comes out of the sun in a sundress running<br>
Like a watercolor in the rain<br>
Don't bother asking for explanations<br>
She'll just tell you that she came from<br>
The Year of the Cat</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE (Twice for heads, twice for sides):</P><br><br>Heads (Sides) promenade halfway<br>
Sides pass the ocean, extend<br>
Split circulate, linear cycle, touch 1/4<br>
Boy run right, everybody zoom<br>
Centers pass thru, swing that girl promenade her<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Don't bother asking for explanations<br>
She'll just tell you that she came from<br>
The Year of the Cat</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>Sides face grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She doesn't give you time for questions<br>
As she locks up your arm in hers<br>
And you follow 'til your sense of which direction<br>
Completely disappears</L></FONT><br>
Allemande left and weave<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>By the blue-tiled walls near the market stalls<br>
There's a hidden door she leads you to<br>
"These days," she says, "I feel my life<br>
Just like a river running through<br>
The Year of the Cat."</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CLOSER</P><br><br>Sides face grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well, morning comes and you're still with her<br>
And the bus and tourists are gone<br>
And you've thrown away your choice and you've lost your ticket<br>
So you have to stay on</L></FONT><br>
Allemande left and weave<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>But the drumbeat strains of the night remain<br>
In the rhythm of the newborn day<br>
You know someday you're bound to leave her<br>
But for now you're gonna stay<br>
In the Year of the Cat</L></FONT><br>
