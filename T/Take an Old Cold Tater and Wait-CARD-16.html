<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*When I was a little boy around the table at home<br>
I remember very well when company would come<br>

My mama always said to me "take an old cold tater and wait"</L></FONT><br>
Do an <C>allemande left</C> that corner girl, come back and <C>dosado</C><br>
<C>Allemande that corner</C>, <C>promenade</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>That is why I look so bad and have these puny ways<br>

Go <C>down the middle</C> <C>pass the ocean</C>, everyone <C>extend</C><br>
<C>Swing thru</C> two by two, all the <C>boys run right</C><br>
<C>Couples circulate</C>, and then you <C>chain down that line</C><br>

Then <C>allemande that corner</C> again and <C>weave around that ring</C><br>

All that chicken they would eat and just leave me a bun<br>
