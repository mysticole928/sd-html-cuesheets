<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Four ladies chain now, go across the ring<br>
You rollaway circle to the left, go round I sing<br>
Four ladies rollaway, you circle left I say<br>
Left allemande then, you weave the ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Hey there's a green light, you're free to go</L></FONT><br>
Swing your partner, promenade you know<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Here's your coat & there's your shoes & don't forget your blues<br>
Your own canoe now, you'll have to row</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head (Side) couples square thru, four hands and go<br>
Going to meet your corner, with a do-sa-do<br>
You do a curlique and then, scoot back and then<br>
The boys fold and, two ladies chain<br>
You send them back dixie style, make that wave<br>
You slip the clutch left allemande, and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Hey there's a smile upon your face while another takes my place<br>
And now at last dear, the truth I've found</L></FONT><br><br>

You lead to the right circle four, and you make a line<br>
Walk up to the middle & back, go right & left thru like that<br>
Star thru square thru, three quarters round<br>
Three hands around now, and the corner swing<br>
Left allemande then, promenade that ring<br>
