<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P><br><br>Grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>There was a square dance group, all swingin', whirling hotrods<br>
They traveled around the country, doing the dances of the land<br>
They'd yell and have a ball, everytime they'd hear the call</L></FONT><br>
Swing and then left allemande, then promenade the hall<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh, the one on the right was on the left<br>
And the line on the left was in the middle<br>
And the one in the middle was on the right<br>
And the one in the rear said swing her</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head 2 ladies chain across, then couples 1 & 3<br>
Square thru in the middle count 4 hands around for me<br>
Swing thru, then box the gnat, square thru 3/4 round<br>
Swing and whirl with the corner girl, then promenade the town<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh, the one on the right was on the left<br>
And the line on the left was in the middle<br>
And the one in the middle was on the right<br>
And the one in the rear was the caller</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>Grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>This dancing aggregation toured the entire nation<br>
Swinging, whirling, all night long, to the dances of the land<br>
But political animosity made 'em goof the call</L></FONT><br>
Swing and then left allemande, then promenade the hall<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh, the one on the right was on the bottom<br>
And the line in the middle was in the top<br>
And the one on the left got a busted arm<br>
And the one in the rear said swing her</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CLOSER</P><br><br>Grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Now this should be a lesson, if you plan to start a dance group<br>
Just practice on your swinging, and do the dances well<br>
But don't start arguing politics, or you're gonna goof the call</L></FONT><br>
Swing and then left allemande, then promenade the hall<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Now, the one on the right works in a bank<br>
And the one in the middle drives a truck<br>
The line on the left's an all-night DJ<br>
And the one in the rear says swing her</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">TAG</P><br><br>Now bow to the partner, corners all<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Cause the one in the rear says that's all</L></FONT><br>
