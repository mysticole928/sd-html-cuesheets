     *As time went on he did his best and all could see he didn't jest
     <br/>
     He practiced on and then some night and day
     <br/>
     His pappy'd find him behind the barn just a workin up an awful storm
     <br/>
     As he tried to imitate the auctioneer
    </span>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="songLyrics">
     **Said his pappy, "Son we just can't stand, a havin' a mediocre man

     You gotta take that auction usin' our good name

     *I'll send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool
     <br/>
     You can take your place among the best"
     <br/>
     So from that morning he went to school there grew a man who played it cool
     <br/>
     He came back home a full-fledged auctioneer
    </span>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="songLyrics">
     **And people came from miles around just to hear him make that rhythmic sound
     <br/>
     That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer
