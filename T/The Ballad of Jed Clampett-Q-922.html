<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Then one day, he was shootin' at some food</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And up through the ground came a bubbling crude</SPAN><BR>
Four boys promenade one time around the ring, you're gonna go<BR>
Come back, swing your lady, promenade around the ring<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Then one day, he was shootin' at some food</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And up through the ground came a bubbling crude</SPAN><BR>

Heads square thru, get four in the middle, count 'em four<BR>
Find the corner lady, make a right hand star<BR>
Heads star by the left hand, go moving around the ring<BR>
To the corner lady meet, do the right and left thru<BR>
Swing thru, two by two, boy run around the girl<BR>
Chain down the line, keep that lady, promenade the ring<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Then one day, he was shootin' at some food</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And up through the ground came a bubbling crude</SPAN><BR>
