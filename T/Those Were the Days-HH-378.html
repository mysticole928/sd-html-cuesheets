Now roll away and circle round the ring<br>
Allemande left, allemande thar, forward two and star<br>
Boys wheel right in, with a right hand in<br>
Slip the clutch, left allemande, now dosado your own<br>
Left allemande, come back and promenade<br>

In the middle star thru, California twirl<br>
Swing thru the outside 2, the boys will run<br>
You do a couples trade, and then you wheel & deal<br>
Dive thru, pass thru, your corner lady swing<br>
Left allemande, come back and promenade<br>
