<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>All the ladies chain across and you turn that pretty Jane<br>
You chain 'em right on home again and turn the girls again<br>
Join your hands and form a ring and circle left I sing<br>
Left allemande the corner girl and weave that ol' ring<br>
It's in and out around you go until you meet your maid<br>
Dosado your lady there and then you promenade<br>
Promenade your lady, go dancing round in time<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Those ringing bells are telling us it's just the square dance time</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 go forward, come back and spin the top<br>
When you're through, box the gnat and look 'er in the eye<br>
Right & left thru a full turn, face the outside 2<br>
Dosado go once around and then you slide thru<br>
Spin the top, one more time, again you box the gnat<br>
Look her in the eye, pull her by, swing the corner Sue<br>
Promenade this lady, go walking down the line<br>
