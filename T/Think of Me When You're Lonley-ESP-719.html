Head square thru count me four hands, make a right hand star<BR>
Heads star left go once inside the ring, to the same two<BR>

* You said that you were leaving, but you wouldn't be gone too long<BR>
With each new day I hope and pray that you'll come travelling home</P>

<P>* Now the waiting is over and time has set the scene<BR>
Yes God meant me for only you and he meant you for me
