     FORMATION: Improper duple (D)
     <br>
     <br>
     Those wishing to dance form 2 parallel lines 4 steps apart, with all the men in one line on the prompter's right and all the ladies in the other line on the prompter's left. Each man faces his partner in the opposite line. Couples 1 &amp; 2, 3 &amp; 4, 5 &amp; 6, etc. constitute "minor sets" for doing a dance sequence together. For this dance couples 1,3,5, etc. should California twirl (cross over) to form a "major set" which is an improper or alternating duple (two). To begin the dance couples 1,3,5, etc. are "active" and remain active after they leave these positions. The prompter's commands are normally directed to the "active" couples.
     <br>
     <br>
     At the beginning of this dance each man's partner is the lady he is facing in the other line and each man's corner is the lady on his left.
     <br>
     <br>
     FOOTWORK: Walk smoothly in the pattern indicated by the prompter. Set your feet to the beat of the music.
     <br>
     <br>
     Beats* Maneuver
     <br>
     <br>
     8 Individuals of the active couples turn 1/4 to face "down" the set while individuals of the inactive couples turn 1/4 to face "up" the set then those facing each other do-sa-do right shoulder around each other to end facing each other
     <br>
     <br>
     8 those facing each other swing twice around to end with the lady on the man's right so that the two couples who were swinging form a line of four people all facing "down" the set
     <br>
     <br>
     8 in order to "go down in fours" the individuals in each line of four people step slightly apart and join inside hands then all walk forward four steps toward the foot or "down" the set
     <br>
     <br>
     8 the two couples in each line of four California Twirl to reform the same line of four now facing "up" the set then each line of four walks four steps toward the head or "up" the set
     <br>
     <br>
     8 the people in each line of four Bend The Line maneuver restoring the original two facing contra lines then the ladies facing each other (diagonally) chain across
     <br>
     <br>
     8 same ladies chain back to be courtesy turned by partner into position on his right in the two facing contra lines
     <br>
     <br>
     8 the same two men and two ladies involved in the chain maneuver make a left hand star in the center and turn it once around counterclockwise
     <br>
     <br>
     8 same two men and two ladies reverse and make a right hand star in the center and turn it once around clockwise until each person resumes his or her starting position in the two facing contra lines
     <br>
     <br>
     8 those men who now have a lady on the left do a do-sa-do with this new corner to start the dance sequence again then continue for 6 sequences
     <br>
     <br>
     NOTE: every other sequence of the dance those (inactive) men at the head and the foot of the set who have no corner lady on the left to do-sa-do with should -cross over- (trade places) with the lady opposite so both can then get back into the dance action.
