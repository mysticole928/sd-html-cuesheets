Heads Square Thru count 'em 4 hands round<br>
You make a Right Hand Star<br>
The Heads Star Left, roll it one time and then<br>
Same pair and do a Dosado<br>
Swing Thru and then the Boys Trade<br>
Swing the corner lady round and Promenade<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">ADDITIONAL LYRICS</P><br><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>* McNicholas's,  Posalski's, the Smith's, Zerillis's Too<br>

The Africans,  the Irish,  the Germans and the Jews  <br>

The Mexicans,  Italians,   and the Asians choose<br>

To make their home<br><br>   





* They worked building railroads, worked to bones and skin<br>

They worked in the fields,  and the factories my friend<br>

Yes they worked to get here,  a hundred years ago<br>

They made their home<br>
