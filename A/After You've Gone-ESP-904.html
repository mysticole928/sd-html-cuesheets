Well now the heads square thru, count four to the rhythm of the band<BR>
When you meet your corner girl you do the right and left thru<BR>
Roll the honey with a half sashay, now touch one quarter<BR>
Hey the boys run right, square thru three hands now<BR>
You're facing out, do a partner trade and roll to face her<BR>
Swing that corner girl and promenade now<BR>
