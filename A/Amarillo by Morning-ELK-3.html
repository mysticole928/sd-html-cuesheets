Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone;</P>Everything that I got is just what I 
got on<br>When that sun is high in that Texas sky,<br>I'll be bucking at the County fair.<br>Amarillo by morning,<br>Amarillo I'll be there.<br>
<br>They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.<br>Lost a wife and 
girlfriend somewhere along the way<br>Well, I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate,<br>And I'll hope that judge ain't blind.<br>Amarillo by morning,<br>Amarillo's on my mind.<br>Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone;<br><br>I ain't got a dime but what I got is mine,<br>I ain't rich but, Lord, I'm free.<br>Amarillo by morning,<br>Amarillo's where I'll be.<br>Amarillo by morning,<br>Amarillo's where I'll be.
