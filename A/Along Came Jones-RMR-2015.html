*The commercial came on, so I got up to get myself a snack<br>
You should have seen what was going on by the time that I got back<br>
You know downin that ole abandoned mine sweet Sue was havin´ fits<br>
Sam said &quot;Give me the deed to the ranch&quot;<br>
<br>
*Well I got so bugged i turned it off and turned to another show<br>
There was the same ole shoot-um-up boys and the same ole rodeo<br>
You know salty Sam was trying to stuff sweet Sue in a burlap sack<br>
Sam said &quot;gimme the deed to the ranch&quot;</span></p>
