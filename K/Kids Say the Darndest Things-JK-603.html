<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Kids say the darndest things<br>
Have you ever listened to the games they play<br>
Or the little songs they sing?</L></FONT><br>
Walk around your corner, turn a left hand round your own<br>
Men star by the ole right hand, once around you roam<br>
Left allemande, oh, weave the ring<br>
Gonna meet your gal with a dosado, promenade that ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Last night, dressed up in high-heeled shoes and wearing my old hat<br>
My four year old said "I want a divorce"<br>
Now where did she hear that?</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Oh heads star thru, pass thru, then circle up 4<br>
Head men break and make a line, go forward up and back once more<br>
Slide thru, pass to the center, swing thru you do<br>
Turn thru, left allemande and weave the ring you do<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well, kids say the darndest things</L></FONT><br>
Meet your gal with a dosado, promenade that ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I'll bet my daddy can whip your daddy<br>
But Daddy's never home<br>
And I think Mom worries bout him, she cried all night long</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Last night as I watched TV, one rushed through the door<br>
Mommy, Daddy's telling someone on the phone<br>
"Don't you call me here, no more"<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">*You never know what they learn at school</P><br><br>My first grader just said a four-letter word<br>
And it sure wasn't "love"</L></FONT><br>
