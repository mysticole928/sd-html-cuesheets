<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Walk all around that corner, turn your partner left and then<br>
The 4 little ladies star by the right, all the way around that ring<br>
Turn your partner left a full turn, just like an allemande thar<br>
Men to the middle, you back right in and make a right hand star<br>
And then you slip the clutch, left allemande, grand right & left go around<br>
Hand over hand till you meet again, then promenade the town<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh we're dancing all night, singing pretty girls, and having lots of fun<br>
Wish you were here, wish you were here</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>4 little ladies chain across, you turn the girls in time<br>
1 & 3 lead to the right and circle, make a line<br>
Dance 8 to the middle and come on back and roll a 1/2 sashay<br>
Pass thru, the ends fold, go right & left thru I say<br>
Then do an eight chain 3 across, that corner lady swing<br>
Swing this girl around and then you promenade that ring<br>
