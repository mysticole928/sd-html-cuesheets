<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Circle left<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Me and Homer Jones and Big John Capp<br>
Had a big crap game goin' back in the alley<br>
And I kept rolling them sevens and winning all them pots</L></FONT><br>
Well reverse back and single file<br>
Lady in the lead, gonna strut and style<br>
Girls back track, 2 times around<br>
Second time you meet now, grand right & left<br>
Hand over hand you go round, promenade the set<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>La da da da da da, when you're hot, you're hot<br>
Put all the money in, let's roll 'em again<br>
When you're hot, you're hot</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 do a right & left thru, turn the girl and roll away<br>
Pass thru and around just one you know, make a line<br>
Forward up and come on back, right & left thru and turn 'em, Jack<br>
Slide thru and go left allemande<br>
Dosado around your partner, swing corner there<br>
Left allemande you know, promenade the square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>La da da da da da, when you're hot, you're hot<br>
Put all the money in, let's roll 'em again<br>
When you're hot, you're hot</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Every time I'd roll them dice, I'd win<br>
And I was just getting ready to roll them again<br>
I heard something behind, turned around, there's a big old cop<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">*When he took us into court, couldn't believe my eyes</P><br><br>Say's "Judge, old buddy, pay that hundred I owe you<br>
Get me out of this spot"</L></FONT><br>
