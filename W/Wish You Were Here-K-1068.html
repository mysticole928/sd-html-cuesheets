<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Join your hands and circle to the left with all your might<br>
Allemande the corner, turn your partner by the right<br>
Now the men star left in the middle of the ring, go once around the land<br>
You come on back and box the gnat and do a wrong way grand<br>
Hand over hand, when you meet your maid<br>
Everyone swing, then promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>When you're dancing with those other guys, I miss you so my dear<br>
Wish you were here, wish you were here</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head 2 couples promenade halfway round the floor<br>
Sides star thru, pass thru, circle 4<br>
Side men break and make a line, move up to the middle and back<br>
You pass thru, wheel & deal, and substitute like that<br>
And then you square thru 3/4 to the corner lady swing<br>
Swing that lady round and round and then you promenade<br>
