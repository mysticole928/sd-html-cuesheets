<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>Join your hands, circle left 'round the land<br>
Full around, when you're home, just drop your hands<br>
Face your partner, box the gnat, girls star left, the men stand pat<br>
(Your) partners now, a right hand turn, left allemande like that<br>
Grand right eight 'till you meet your lady fair<br>
Greet her there, then you promenade the square<br>
At home you'll swing her high<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>In your arms she'll always sigh<br>
I'll go wild, simply wild over you</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads/sides go forward up & back then square thru<br>
4 hands round then you face the outside 2<br>
Join hands & circle left, 1 full turn and keep in step<br>
Inside two, you rip & snort*, make a line of 4, you bet<br>
Forward 8, then come back, pass on thru & u-turn back<br>
Bend the line, then box the gnat in front of you<br>
Change girls & swing awhile, promenade go 'bout a mile<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And she'll go wild, simply wild over you</L></FONT><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">*Rip and snort: From a circle, the designated couple leads across the middle, pulling the sides with them. They duck under the arch formed by the opposite couple & there they release their joined hands. The lady leads around to the right back to form 1 end of a line, taking her side of the line with her.  The man leads around to the left with his side to form other part of line. The arching couple as the lines go through, must, of course, turn under its own arch, the man right, the lady left.  Thus, the line is formed facing the center of the square.</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
