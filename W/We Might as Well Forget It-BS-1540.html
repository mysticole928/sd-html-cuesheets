<br><P CLASS="hdr">Join hands make a ring, circle left around that ring</P><br><br>Let the gents star left around, you better turn it once around<br>
Swing your little lady round and round<br>
And then those four ladies chain, turn opposite a left hand swing<br>
Chain 'em back, here comes your maid, do a roll promenade<br>
Promenade go round that ring, you better take her home and swing<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Docey round your corner girl, and then you swing with your own<br>
Head two pass thru, around one you roam<br>
Into the middle and square thru, 3/4 round you do<br>
Swing that corner lady facing you<br>
Allemande left with just one, pass right by the one you swung<br>
Turn the next with a left hand round, promenade your corner round<br>
