<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I spent a fourth of my life chasing women<br>
I guess square dancing took up another quarter (more like a half)<br>
My whole life long has been wine, women and song<br>
But not necessarily in that order<br>
There ain't much I ain't done, but I sure had some fun<br>
The worst I ever had it was the best<br>
That's the way my life's been spent, about 90%<br>
And I guess I just wasted the rest</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Well now the <C>heads</C> <C>square thru</C> in the middle and gonna get 4 around<br>
Gonna meet old corner, do a <C>dosado</C><br>
<C>Swing thru</C> tonight, those <C>boys run to the right</C><br>
<C>Couples circulate</C>, move up, you <C>wheel & deal</C><br>
You <C>pass thru</C> and <C>trade by</C>, <C>pass thru</C> and then<br>
<C>Allemande left</C>, <C>swing</C> on the next and <C>promenade</C><br>
