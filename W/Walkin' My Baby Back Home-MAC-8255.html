     This dance was written with the purpose in mind to keep all dancers aware of the full count that each maneuver takes to execute. All steps in this dance sequence, except for the first eight counts of the figure and the hand clapping sequence, are to be done with a Walk, Two, Three, Brush movement. Do not rush the execution of the dance and be sure to allow for smoothness that can be obtained. Many uses can be offered to a dance of this type such as demonstration or exhibition for groups of non-dancers, a little something to use for a change of pace at a regular square dance, home patio parties and children's square dance groups. The clapping of hands was thrown in for the fun element you obtain from a figure of this nature. Remember the fun you have in Patty Cake Polka?
     <br>
     <br>
     POSITION: Dancers are in square including four couples and to start the dance each person is facing their partner with gent's left shoulder toward center of square and lady's right shoulder towards center, hands are joined. The dance starts with a grapevine step in towards the center (side, behind, side, swing) and then a grapevine out, then you take it from there.
     <br>
     <br>
     CALLER'S NOTE: This dance has to be used for the dancers for a few times until they have it established in their minds.
