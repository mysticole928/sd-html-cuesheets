Heads square thru four hands around you do<BR>
And with the sides make a right hand star<BR>
Heads star left a full turn around<BR>
Swing thru the outside two, Now spin your top<BR>
The boys move up slide thru<BR>
Then swing the corner girl and promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally?<BR>
Who's making love to her tonight?</SPAN>
