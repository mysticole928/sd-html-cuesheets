   Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day
   <br>
   Were you in the yard with your wife and children
   <br>
   Or working on some stage in LA
   <br>
   Did you stand there in shock at the site of that black smoke
   <br>
   Rising against that blue sky
   <br>
   Did you shout out in anger
   <br>
   In fear for your neighbor
   <br>
   Or did you just sit down and cry
   <br>
   Did you weep for the children
   <br>
   Who lost their dear loved ones
   <br>
   And pray for the ones who don't know
   <br>
   Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
   <br>
   And sob for the ones left below
   <br>
   Did you burst out in pride
   <br>
   For the red white and blue
   <br>
   And the heroes who died just doin' what they do
   <br>
   Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
   <br>
   And look at yourself and what really matters
   <br>

   <div class="indent30">
    <br>
    I'm just a singer of simple songs
    <br>
    I'm not a real political man
    <br>
    I watch CNN but I'm not sure I could tell you
    <br>
    The difference in Iraq and Iran
    <br>
    But I know Jesus and I talk to God
    <br>
    And I remember this from when I was young
    <br>
    Faith hope and love are some good things He gave us
    <br>
    And the greatest is love

    <br>
    Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day
    <br>
    Teaching a class full of innocent children
    <br>
    Or driving down some cold interstate
    <br>
    Did you feel guilty cause you're a survivor
    <br>
    In a crowded room did you feel alone
    <br>
    Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her
    <br>
    Did you dust off that Bible at home
    <br>
    Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
    <br>
    Close your eyes and not go to sleep
    <br>
    Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
    <br>
    Or speak to some stranger on the street
    <br>
    Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
    <br>
    Go out and buy you a gun
    <br>
    Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
    <br>
    And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns
    <br>
    Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
    <br>
    Stand in line and give your own blood
    <br>
    Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
    <br>
    Thank God you had somebody to love
