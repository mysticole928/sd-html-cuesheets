     Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day
     <br>
     Were you in the yard with your wife and children
     <br>
     Or working on some stage in LA
     <br>
     Did you stand there in shock at the site of that black smoke
     <br>
     Rising against that blue sky
     <br>
     Did you shout out in anger
     <br>
     In fear for your neighbor
     <br>
     Or did you just sit down and cry
     <br>
     Did you weep for the children
     <br>
     Who lost their dear loved ones
     <br>
     And pray for the ones who don't know
     <br>
     Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
     <br>
     And sob for the ones left below
     <br>
     Did you burst out in pride
     <br>
     For the red white and blue
     <br>
     And the heroes who died just doin' what they do
     <br>
     Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
     <br>
     And look at yourself and what really matters

     I'm just a singer of simple songs
     <br>
     I'm not a real political man
     <br>
     I watch CNN but I'm not sure I could tell you
     <br>
     The difference in Iraq and Iran
     <br>
     But I know Jesus and I talk to God
     <br>
     And I remember this from when I was young
     <br>
     Faith hope and love are some good things He gave us
     <br>
     And the greatest is love

     Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day
     <br>
     Teaching a class full of innocent children
     <br>
     Or driving down some cold interstate
     <br>
     Did you feel guilty cause you're a survivor
     <br>
     In a crowded room did you feel alone
     <br>
     Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her
     <br>
     Did you dust off that Bible at home
     <br>
     Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
     <br>
     Close your eyes and not go to sleep
     <br>
     Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
     <br>
     Or speak to some stranger on the street
     <br>
     Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
     <br>
     Go out and buy you a gun
     <br>
     Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
     <br>
     And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns
     <br>
     Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
     <br>
     Stand in line and give your own blood
     <br>
     Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
     <br>
     Thank God you had somebody to love
