Heads Square Thru count 'em 4 hands round<br>
You make a Right Hand Star<br>
The Heads Star Left, roll it one time and then<br>
Same pair and do a Dosado<br>

Swing the corner lady round and Promenade<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Back in 1876 an ol' boy named Bell <br>
Invented a contraption that we know so well <br>
By the 1950's they were in everybody's home <br>
As a crazy little thing they call the telephone<br>
So tell me why, haven't I heard from you <br>
I say now: Darlin', honey<br>
what is your excuse <br>
Why haven't I heard from you <br>
 <br>
The service man he told me that my phone is working fine <br>
And I've come to the conclusion trouble isn't with my line <br>
I'm sure the operator will be glad to put you thru <br>
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you <br>
 <br>
There better been a flood, a landslide of mud <br>
A fire that burns up the wires <br>
And a thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud <br>
A natural disaster I know nothin' about<br>
