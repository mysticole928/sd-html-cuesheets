<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Join hands and just circle, you travel that ring<br>
Allemande with the corner, dosado with your Jane<br>
Well now those men star left, 1 time and them<br>
Box the gnat, pull by, then allemande left<br>
You weave the ring, now it's in and out you know<br>
When you meet your girl, you dosado and promenade around you go<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Winchester Cathedral, you're breaking me down<br>
You stood and you watched as my baby left town</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head couples promenade 1/2 around that square<br>
Same ladies chain now, you turn them right there<br>
You spin the top now and when you're through, turn thru<br>
Left allemande and you weave that old ring<br>
It's in and out now, meet the girl you know<br>
You dosado, go back to the corner<br>
Swing and promenade, go around the ring<br>
