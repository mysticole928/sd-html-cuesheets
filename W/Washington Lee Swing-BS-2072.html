<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Sides face your partner, everybody grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>We took the legs from some old table<br>
We took the arms from some old chair<br>
And for a neck we used a bottle<br>
And from a horse we took some hair</L></FONT><br>
4 ladies promenade go one time around that ring<br>
And when you're home you swing<br>
Swing your honey round and round and promenade that ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And I got more lovin' from that gosh darn dummy<br>
Than I ever got from you</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Well now the heads lead to the right and circle 4 you know<br>
You break and make a line, go forward up and back you go<br>
Now pass thru, chase right and when you're through<br>
And then you square thru 3 hands, now the corner swing<br>
Left allemande, come back and you can promenade that ring<br>
You promenade that ring, take your honey home again<br>
