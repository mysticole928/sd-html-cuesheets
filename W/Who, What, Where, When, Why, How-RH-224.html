Walk into the middle & do the right & left thru<br>
You flutterwheel across that floor, sweep 1/4 more<br>
You pass thru & do the right & left thru<br>
Why don't you swing thru & then you swing thru again<br>
Swing that corner girl & promenade my friend<br>

Why should you be so ungrateful<br>
How can you forget the vows we made</L></FONT><br>
