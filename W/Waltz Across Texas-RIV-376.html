</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>It’s a fairyland tale that comes true.<br>
</L></FONT>Left Allemande that corner, Turn the partner by the Right<br>
And the Men Star Left around you do.<br>
Turn the partner Right, then you go Left Allemande<br>
Swing your girl and Promenade<br>

Those heads [sides] Promenade, go half way around.<br>
Walk in and Square Thru to four, go all the way around now.<br>
Make a Right Hand Star and turn it half way around<br>
As a couple Veer to the Left, Couples Circulate<br>
Chain Down the Line, but turn her ‘till you can Promenade<br>
