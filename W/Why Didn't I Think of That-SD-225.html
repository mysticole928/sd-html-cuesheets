     When she gets down, well, he's always around now

     He makes her smile again
     <br>
     He mends her heartaches; remembers her birthday and tries to be a friend
     <br>
     Now that she's gone I know what I did wrong; it's all so simple in fact:

     He says he wants her; can't live without her
