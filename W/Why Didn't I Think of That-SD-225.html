     (lyrics for Opener)

     <span class="lyrics">
      He sends her roses and lines he composes; things a lady loves
      <br>
      Well, he's there to hold when she needs a shoulder if life gets too rough
      <br>
      Oh, now that she's left I keep kickin' myself whenever I start thinkin' back
      <br>
      He says he needs her; tells her he loves her

      Ooh, I've been watchin', every move that he makes
      <br>
      Ooh...I've been thinkin', it coulda been different somehow
      <br>
      He sings her love songs, and tells her his love's strong; things she needs to know
      <br>
      I did my best, thought of everything else

     (lyrics for Closer)
     <br>
     <span class="lyrics">
      When she gets down, well, he's always around now
      <br>
      He makes her smile again
      <br>
      He mends her heartaches; remembers her birthday and tries to be a friend
      <br>
      Now that she's gone I know what I did wrong; it's all so simple in fact:
      <br>
      He says he wants her; can't live without her
      <br>
      Why didn't I think of that?
