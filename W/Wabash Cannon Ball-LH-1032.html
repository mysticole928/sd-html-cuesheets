All 4 ladies promenade, once around that ring<br>
Right back home and swing, everybody swing<br>
Promenade this lady, <FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>we're gonna have a ball<br>
Take your cutie for a ride on the Wabash Cannon Ball</L></FONT><br>

Break right out to a line of 4, watch the ladies smile<br>
Right & left thru turn 'em too, pass the ocean go<br>
Swing thru and when you're through, scoot back you know<br>
Step right into an ocean wave, recycle too<br>
Pass thru, swing a new girl, promenade her too<br>

How we love the choo-choo of the Wabash Cannon Ball<br>
Hear the bell and whistle calling, hear the wheels that go clack-clack<br>
Hear the roaring of the engine as she rolls along the track<br>
