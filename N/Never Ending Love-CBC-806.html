<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">I've got a never ending love for you<BR>
From now on that's all I want to do</SPAN><BR>
Do an allemande left with the corner, dosado your own<BR>
Allemande left with the corner, weave the ring<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Wind in and out around the ring and go</SPAN><BR>
When you meet a little lady swing that lady and promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And from the first time we met I knew<BR>
I had a never ending love for you</SPAN><BR>

<BR>
Well those heads promenade and go halfway<BR>
Walk into the middle and square thru now - four hands around go<BR>
Go all the way and do the right and left thru you know<BR>
Veer over to the left, you ferris wheel around and then<BR>
Centres pass the ocean there, explode the wave and then<BR>
Corner swing, swing the lady around and promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And from the first time we met I knew<BR>
I had a never ending love for you</SPAN><BR>

Well those heads promenade and go halfway<BR>
Walk into the middle and square thru now - four hands around go<BR>
Go all the way and then swing thru you know<BR>
Men run to the right, you ferris wheel around and then<BR>
Centres veerto the left, Crossfire<BR>
Walk and dodge, Swing your corner, Promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And from the first time we met I knew<BR>
I had a never ending love for you</SPAN><BR>
