<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head couples bow and swing, and promenade that old ring<br>
Halfway round, sides go right & left thru<br>
4 ladies chain across from home<br>
Head two couples forward up and back you roam<br>
And then you cross trail thru and travel around just one<br>
4 in line, forward up, back with you<br>
1/2 square thru that ring, u-turn back and swing<br>
Swing that little lady, promenade again<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Your corner dosado and circle 8 you know<br>
Take that lady along with you<br>
Gents will star left from where you are<br>
You turn your partner right into a wrong way thar<br>
And then you back right up in that left hand star<br>
Shoot it now, ladies promenade<br>
Dosado at home once around your own<br>
You promenade that lady round that ring<br>
