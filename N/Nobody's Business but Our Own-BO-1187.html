<P CLASS="hdr">*Lines trade: From an ocean wave or two-faced line.  Dancers facing the same direction trade places with each other in their own line, passing right shoulders.  All move at the same time and end up in the same line they started in but facing in opposite direction.  No need to balance.</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
