<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P><br><br>Circle left<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>When I saw you buyin' Cosmo and a hot rod magazine<br>

I said to myself, "Now there's a girl for me"</L></FONT><br>

Left allemande your corner, do a dosado<br>

Men star left and turn it one time and go<br>

You turn the partner by the right and left allemande<br>

Swing your girl and promenade the land<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I said, "How 'bout some music?" You said, "Got any Merle?"<br>

That's when I knew you were my kind of girl.</L></FONT><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE (twice for the heads, twice for the sides)</P><br><br>The heads (sides) square thru and get 4 hands around you go<br>

Dosado your corner one time you know<br>

Swing thru today, those boys run I say<br>

Bend the line go right & left thru and turn her today<br>

Flutterwheel straight across now, slide thru<br>

Swing that corner girl, promenade you do<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And when we went to dinner you wore blue jeans with your pearls<br>

That's when I knew you were my kind of girl.</L></FONT><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>Sides face grand square<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You march to the beat of a different drum<br>

The funny thing is that I hear the same one<br>

We both like to color outside of the lines<br>

We're peas in a pod...</L></FONT><br>

All four ladies promenade<br>

Well, get back home and swing your man and go<br>

Keep that one â€“ promenade 'round you know<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And when we went to dinner you wore blue jeans with your pearls<br>

That's when I knew you were my kind of girl.</L></FONT><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">CLOSER</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I said, "I think I love you," you said "What's not to love?"<br>

I thought about a kiss but I wasn't quick enough</L></FONT><br>

Left allemande your corner, dosado your own<br>

The men star left and turn it one time and go<br>

Turn the partner by the right and left allemande<br>

Swing your lady, promenade the land<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You set my head a-spinnin' just like a tilt-a-whirl<br>

That's when I knew you were my kind of girl.</L></FONT><br>
