      Well, when I was a kid I'd take a trip
      <br>
      Every summer down to Mississipp'
      <br>
      To visit my granny in her antebellum world
      <br>
      I'd run barefooted all day long
      <br>
      Climbin' trees, free as a song
      <br>
      And one day I happened to catch myself a squirrel
     </span>

      Well, I stuffed him down in an old shoe box
      <br>
      Punched a couple of holes in the top
      <br>
      And when Sunday came I snuck him into church
      <br>
      I was sittin' way back in the very last pew
      <br>
      Showin' him to my good buddy Hugh
      <br>

      As the choir sang "I Surrender All"

      The squirrel ran up Harv Newlan's coveralls

      Well, seven deacons and the pastor got saved
      <br>
      And twenty-five thousand dollars got raised
      <br>
      And fifty volunteered for missions in the Congo on the spot
      <br>
      And without so much as an invitation
      <br>
      There was five hundred re-dedications
      <br>
      And we all got baptized whether we needed it or not
