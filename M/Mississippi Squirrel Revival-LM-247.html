     Well, when I was a kid I'd take a trip
     <br/>
     Every summer down to Mississipp'
     <br/>
     To visit my granny in her antebellum world
     <br/>
     I'd run barefooted all day long
     <br/>
     Climbin' trees, free as a song
     <br/>
     And one day I happened to catch myself a squirrel

     Well, I stuffed him down in an old shoe box
     <br/>
     Punched a couple of holes in the top
     <br/>
     And when Sunday came I snuck him into church
     <br/>
     I was sittin' way back in the very last pew
     <br/>
     Showin' him to my good buddy Hugh
     <br/>
     When that squirrel got loose and went totally beserk

     As the choir sang "I Surrender All"

     The squirrel ran up Harv Newlan's coveralls

     Well, seven deacons and the pastor got saved
     <br/>
     And twenty-five thousand dollars got raised
     <br/>
     And fifty volunteered for missions in the Congo on the spot
     <br/>
     And without so much as an invitation
     <br/>
     There was five hundred re-dedications
