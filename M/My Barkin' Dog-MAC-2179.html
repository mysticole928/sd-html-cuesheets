<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>Sides face, grand square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*I was standin' on the corner, heard my bulldog bark<br>
Ran home an hour early, it was just past dark<br>
My dog was barkin' louder and when I walked in<br>
The back door was open, there's that dog again</L></FONT><br>
Left allemande that corner lady, do a dosado<br>
Now men you promenade inside, it's once around you go<br>
Pick up your partner, promenade around the bend<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I know my dog is my best friend</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Now those heads promenade, it's half around you go<br>
2 & 4 (1 & 3) right & left thru and turn the girl you know<br>
Star thru, California twirl, swing the corner girl<br>
Left allemande, come back one and weave that ring go<br>
(music interlude)<br>
Dosado that girl, you promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>My dog is barkin' louder and he's my best friend<br>
Looks out for me right to the end</L></FONT><br>

Somethin' hit me on the head from up above<br>
I looked up and that was when the lights went out<br>
A feelin' in the dark, someone began to shout</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr"><L>*He went out the back door just as I walked in</P><br><br>The lights went on, hey buddy what's it all about?<br>
Everybody's laughin, they began to shout</L></FONT><br>
