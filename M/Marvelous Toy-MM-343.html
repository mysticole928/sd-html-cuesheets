     *When I was just a wee little lad, full of health and joy
     <br/>
     My father homeward came one night and gave to me a toy
     <br/>
     A wonder to behold, it was, with many colors bright
     <br/>
     The moment I laid eyes on it, it became my heart's delight
    </span>
    <br/>
    All four ladies promenade, once inside that ring
    <br/>
    Get back home and swing 'em round and promenade I sing
    <br/>
    <span class="songLyrics">
     It went "zip" when it moved and "bop" when it stopped and "whirr" when it stood still
     <br/>
     I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

     *It first marched left and then marched right, then marched right under a chair
     <br/>
     And when l looked where it had gone, it wasn't even there
     <br/>
     I started to sob and my daddy laughed, for he knew what I'd find
     <br/>
     When l turned around my marvelous toy was chugging from behind

     *The years have gone too quickly by, I now have my own boy
     <br/>
     And yesterday I gave to him my marvelous little toy
     <br/>
     His eyes almost popped out of his head and he gave a squeal of glee
     <br/>
     Neither of us knows what it is but he loves it, just like me
