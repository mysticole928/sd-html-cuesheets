     Well, when I was a kid I'd take a trip every summer down the Mississipp'
     <br/>
     To visit my granny in her antebellum world
     <br/>
     I'd run barefooted all day long climbin' trees free as a song
     <br/>
     And one day I happened to catch myself a squirrel

     Well, I stuffed him down in an old shoe box, punched a couple of holes in the top

     And when Sunday came I snuck him into church
