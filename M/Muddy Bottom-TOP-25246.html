<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO</P><br><br>Circle left<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Us country boys don't perspire and city girls don't sweat<br>
But any fool can tell you, either one will get you wet</L></FONT><br>
Walk all around your corner, and star thru at home<br>
California twirl, left allemande and weave the ring now<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Muddy Bottom is a cornfield that my daddy left to me</L></FONT><br>
Dosado this lady and promenade you see<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>To the hottest place this side of where nobody wants to be<br>
You'll do one or the other, down in Muddy Bottom</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 lead to the right, and circle 4 you know<br>
Head gent break and you make a line, it's up and back you go<br>
Pass thru, go on to the next with a right & left thru you do<br>
Then flutter wheel, and when you're through<br>
Sweep 1/4, then pass thru, swing the corner girl<br>
Left allemande, come back and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>To that stretch along the river bank, way down in Tennessee<br>
Ruddy, cruddy good old Muddy Bottom</L></FONT><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I handered for the city and all them city lights<br>
So I lit out to make my way to see them city sights</L></FONT><br>
Walk all around your corner, and star thru at home<br>
California twirl, left allemande and weave the ring now<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Muddy Bottom is as lonely as a busy city street</L></FONT><br>
Dosado this lady and promenade for me<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I've come to this conclusion, Muddy Bottom's hard to beat<br>
Now I wonder why I left old Muddy Bottom</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CLOSER</P><br><br>Circle left<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I sure do miss my river and my secret fishin' pool<br>
I miss the girls I chased down through the cornfields after school</L></FONT><br>
