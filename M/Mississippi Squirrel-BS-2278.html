<P CLASS="hdr">LEAD IN VOCALS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well now, gather round you all<br>
I'm fixin' to tell you a tale<br>
A squirrel tale, that is, that's gonna warm your little pea-pickin' heart</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>Heads in, grand spin<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>When I was a kid I took a trip, caught me a squirrel in ole Mississipp'<br>
Snuck 'em into church to show my good buddy Hugh<br>
That squirrel got loose I'm tellin' y'all, he ran up Harv Newman's overalls<br>
Ole Harv yelled "somp'in got a hold on me...yeow!"<br>
*The day the squirrel went berserk, in the first self-righteous church<br>
In that sleepy little town of Pascagoula<br>
It was a fight for survival, that broke out in revival<br>
They was jumpin' pews and shoutin' Hallelujah</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads promenade y'all, take 'em halfway round the hall<br>
Walk in and square thru go 4 hands<br>
4 hands round the collection plate, right & left thru there mate<br>
Veer left and ferris wheel for me<br>
Square thru 3 hands to the vestibule, right & left thru too<br>
Swing sister St. Clarice and promenade her<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>That squirrel ran across to the amen pew<br>
There sat sister Bertha better than you<br>
He ran up her dress, drove her plum insane<br>
She yelped then started to confess, about her love life and you can bet<br>
She got their attention when she started naming names</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CLOSER</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I know you've heard the stories told of all the wonders of the days of old<br>
And the miracles that were wrought in this old world<br>
But the one I'll remember 'til my dying day<br>
Is how we were put back on the narrow way<br>
By a half-crazed Mississippi squirrel</L></FONT><br>
