Grand Square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I ran barefooted all day long, climbing trees, free as a song<br>
</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>One day I happened to catch myself a squirrel<br>
</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well, I stuffed him down in an old shoe box, and punched a couple of holes in the top <br>
</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>When Sunday came I snuck him into church <br>
</L></FONT>Four Ladies Promenade one time<br>
Swing your girl around and Promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>It was a fight for survival, that broke out in revival<br>
</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>They were jumpin' pews and shoutin' hallelujah<br>

Heads Square Thru count 'em 4 hands round<br>
You make a Right Hand Star<br>
The Heads Star Left, roll it one time and then<br>
Same pair and do a Dosado<br>
Swing Thru and then the Boys Trade<br>
Swing the corner lady round and Promenade<br>
