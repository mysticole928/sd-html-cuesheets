<P CLASS="hdr">(Note: The first movement used in the figure is the recent (new) basic "Uncouple".  If the caller wishes to use this designation to familiarize his dancers with the term and movement he may change the call words by substituting the ALTERNATE PATTER above.)</P><br><br>Uncouple: Two couples are in a right hand star. Go one full turn around in star and stop at exact place star was formed. Drop hands and face them; take the next call (whatever it is) with this same couple.<br>
