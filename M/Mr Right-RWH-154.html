<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>It was a ro- ro- ro- romantic night<br>
The night she first met Mr. Right</L></FONT><br>
Left allemande and then, turn partner by the right<br>
Allemande left again and weave the ring tonight<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh, gold is not as golden as his golden hair</L></FONT><br>
Swing and whirl and promenade the square<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Oh, he stole her heart but it was such grand theft<br>
She thought he was Mr. Right - but he left!</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE (twice for heads, twice for sides)</P><br><br>Here's where those heads promenade halfway you do<br>
Come down that middle, do the right & left thru<br>
Come on now you square thru and go 4 hands you know<br>
Make a right hand star halfway, veer left<br>
You ferris wheel and then, centers pass thru (oooh!)<br>
Swing that corner lady and promenade you do<br>
