Promenade that lady round the ring you go<br>
Head two couples wheel around, a right & left thru and turn the girl<br>
Cross trail back, swing that corner lady round<br>
Allemande left new corner girl, walk right by your own<br>
Swing the right hand lady man, promenade her home<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1st and 3rd promenade halfway round the ring you do<br>
2 & 4 go right & left thru, turn the girl<br>
4 ladies chain across that town, turn the girl with an arm around<br>
Join your hands, make a ring, and circle left<br>
Allemande left your corner, walk right by your own<br>
Swing the right hand lady round, promenade her home<br>
