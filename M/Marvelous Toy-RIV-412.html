      <span class="lyrics">When I was just a wee little lad, full of health and joy<br>
      My father homeward came one night, and gave to me a toy<br>
      A wonder to behold it was, with many colors bright<br>
      And the moment I laid eyes on it,</span> Allemande and Weave tonight<br>
      <span class="lyrics">It went "zip" when it moved, and "bop" when it stopped<br>
      And "whirr" when it stood still</span><br>
      Swing your lady, go once around, and Promenade the ring<br>
      <span class="lyrics">"Zip" when it moved and "bop" when it stopped<br>
      And "whirr" when it stood still<br>
      I never knew just what it was, and I guess I never will</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Break Lyrics</h2>
    <p class="lyrics">
    The first time that I picked it up I had a big surprise<br>
    'Cause right on the bottom were two big buttons that looked like big green eyes<br>
    I first pushed one and then the other, then I twisted its lid<br>
    And when I set it down again...<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Closer Lyrics</h2>
    <p class="lyrics">
    The years went by too quick it seems, I had my own little boy<br>
    And yesterday I gave to him my marvelous little toy<br>
    His eyes nearly popped right out of his head, and gave a squeal of glee<br>
    Neither one of us knows what it is...<br> 
    </p>
    <h1>FIGURE</h1>
    <p>
      Heads / Sides Square Thru, 4 hands around the ring you go<br>
      Out to the corner with a Do Sa Do, make an Ocean Wave you know<br>
      Swing Thru and then, Spin The Top my friend<br>
      Boy move up and a Right and Left Thru, and turn the girl again<br>
      Touch a Quarter here, and all the Girls run Right<br>
      Swing the boy in front of you and Promenade tonight<br>
      <span class="lyrics">It went "Zip" when it moved and "bop" when it stopped<br>
      And "whirr" when it stood still<br>
      I never knew just what it was, and I guess I never will</span>
