<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Four ladies gonna chain across that ring go<br>
Join up hands circle to the left around I sing<br>
Then roll a half sashay circle to the left that same old way<br>
Then roll away and weave that old ring<br>
Its in and out you go when you meet that gal you know<br>
Do a do-sa-do and then you promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well I would merrly marry with Mary<br>
If only Mary would marry with me</L></FONT><br><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads (sides) square thru four hands you go<br>
Split those two and make a line of four<br>
Go up and back in time, pass thru tag the line<br>
Face in and do the right & left thru (slide thru)<br>
Do an allemande left that corner, come on back and do-sa-do<br>
Go back swing that corner girl, and you promenade<br>
