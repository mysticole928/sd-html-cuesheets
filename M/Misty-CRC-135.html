<BR>
<BR>
Four little ladies chain you turn that girl and chain them right back home<BR>
Join hands and circle left, Left allemande and weave<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">* Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree</SPAN><BR>
Swing that girl and Promenade<SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><BR>
# I can't understand, I get misty just holding your hand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P>
<BR>
<BR>
Heads square thru four hands and then dosado<BR>
Gonna make your ocean wave and then you swing thru<BR>
And the boys run right, Couples circulate and now you Ferris wheel you go<BR>
Let's double pass thru, all the leaders partner trade<BR>
Swing that corner girl, we'll all promenade<BR>

* Walk my way and a thousand violins begin to play</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><SPAN CLASS="lyrics"># That music I hear, I get misty the moment you're near</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><SPAN CLASS="lyrics">* On my own, should I wander through this wonderland alone - never
knowing my right foot from my left, my hat from my glove, I'm misty and so much in love</SPAN></SPAN>
