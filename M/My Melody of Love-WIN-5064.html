Four ladies promenade one time around that ring<BR>
Get back home - swing your honey round and round you swing<BR>
Do an allemande left your corner, dosado at home<BR>
Four men star by the left, one time around you roam<BR>
Home you go, turn thru, with the corner allemande<BR>
Come back just one and promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Return to me and always be</SPAN><BR>

Hey, one and three lead to the right, you circle four and make a line<BR>
Up to the middle and back, touch a quarter in time<BR>
Coordinate (go once and a half), and when you're there<BR>
Star thru, dive thru, square thru three quarters round you go<BR>
Weave that ring, go in and out around that ring you go<BR>
Swing that corner lady, promenade home<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Return to me and always be</SPAN><BR>
