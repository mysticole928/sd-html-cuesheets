Swing the corner lady round and Promenade<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">ADDITIONAL LYRICS</P><br><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>That girl is pretty wild now - the girl's a super freak <br>The kind of girl you read about - in new-wave magazines <br>That girl is pretty kinky - the girl's a super freak <br>I really love to taste her - every time we meet<br><br>



She's a very special girl The kind of girl you want to know <br>From her head down to her toenails <br>Down to her feet Yet she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends In a limousine<br>

Chrome and black and shiny, now
