Circle left<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">It's only a shanty in old shanty town</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Roof is so slanty, It touches the ground</SPAN><BR>
Men star right, one time around tonight<BR>
Left allemande and weave the ring<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">I'd give up my palace, If I were a king</SPAN><BR>
Swing your girl and promenade around that ring<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">There's a queen waitin' there with a silvery crown<BR>
In that shanty in old shanty town</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
Heads promenade, half way around<BR>
Right and left thru, Turn the girl around<BR>
Square thru, Four hands around you know<BR>
Dosado that corner, once around<BR>
Touch a quarter, follow your neighbour and spread<BR>
To the corner - swing that corner and promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">There's a queen waitin' there with a silvery crown<BR>
In that shanty in old shanty town</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATIVE BREAK OR CLOSE</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">There's a shanty in the town, In a little bit of ground</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Where the green grass grows all around, all around</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Loose stone, roof's going, How it tumbles to the ground</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Just a little grass shack, Set way back</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">25 feet from the railway track, Hangs on my heart all the time</SPAN><BR>
Allemande and weave <BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Be so happy oh so happy, If I were a king wouldn't mean a thing</SPAN><BR>
Promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Hey a queen waitin' there, In her rocking chair<BR>
Blowing her top and combing her hair<BR>
Looking all around and trucking on down<BR>
Cause I've gotta get back to my shanty town</SPAN>
