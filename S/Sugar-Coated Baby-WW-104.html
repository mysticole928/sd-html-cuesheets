Allemande left, the ladies star, men run around you go<BR>
Allemande left, the men star, girls run around you know<BR>
Allemande left your corner, right hand around your girl<BR>
Allemande left, grand right and left, go around the world<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">I'm just like a kitten playing with string</SPAN><BR>

Promande your lady, all the way around<BR>

Head two ladies chain across, turn her with a left hand around<BR>
Lead to the right, circle four and you go halfway around<BR>
Dive thru, pass thru, split two, around one you go<BR>
Into the middle with a right hand star, turn it once around<BR>
Allemande your corner, dosado your own<BR>
Back and swing your corner, you promenade her home<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">She's as sweet as honey, all the way around</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">She's sugar-coated, all the way down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATIVE BREAK</P>

Allemande left your corner right hand around your girl<BR>
The men star left, it's once around that world<BR>
Turn your partner by the right, your corner by the left<BR>
Dosado your partner, then weave around the set<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">I'm just like a kitten playing with string</SPAN><BR>
When I dosado my baby, and give her a swing<BR>
Promande your lady, all the way around<BR>
