<BR>
Walk around your corner, Seesaw your own<BR>
Join up your hands, circle to the left around you go<BR>
Four men star by the right one time around<BR>
Allemande that corner, weave the ring<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">* Come-a-lou, come-a-lou, come-a-high, come-a-low</SPAN><BR>
Meet the girl you know, dosado<BR>
** Promenade her home, promenade this girl down the merry street<BR>
And get back home help me sing my happy mel-o-dy<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P>

<BR>
Lets have the heads promenade halfway round<BR>
Walk into the middle, Square thru four hands around<BR>
Four hands around the ring and then go right and left thru<BR>
Hey veer to the left and ferris wheel and go<BR>
Square thru you get about three<BR>
Swing that corner girl and promenade for me<BR>
You take her right back home again<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Come a-ran-tan-tan, a dippy-dow-dow, hear that growl of the bow-wow-wow</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And the bugles horn, and the fire in the diddle and the cat's in fiddle and go</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="hdr">TAG</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
Gonna bow to the partner and the corner too, that's it, that's all!<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATIVES</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">* Birds of all creation are twittering in the trees</SPAN><BR>
Swing that girl, promenade for me, you take your lady, you walk her back home<BR>
Get back and swing with your Summertime Dream</P>
<P>** Promenade your honey, and you know just what I mean<BR>
You take her right back home and she's your Summertime Dream</P>
