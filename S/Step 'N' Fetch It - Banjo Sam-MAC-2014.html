     There is no call for this dance. A set is squared up the same as for a square dance. Everybody is active and all movements are done in 8 counts. The dance starts out with the head couples going forward and back while the side couples are swinging.
     <br>
     <br>
     Heads:
     <br>
     <br>
     <span class="call">
     </span>
     Forward 1, 2, 3, 4
     <br>
     Back up 1, 2, 3, 4
     <br>
     Forward, split your corner and come back to your partner (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
     <br>
     Then swing your partners (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
     <br>
     Then separate and dosado your corners (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
     <br>
     and back up to the home position
     <br>
     You are now ready to start from the beginning
     <br>
     <br>
     Sides:
     <br>
     <br>
     While the heads are going forward and back
     <br>
     The sides will swing (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
     <br>
     Then separate and dosado your corners (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
     <br>
     backing up to the home position
     <br>
     Then forward 1, 2, 3, 4
     <br>
     and back 1, 2, 3, 4
     <br>
     Forward again and split their corners and come back
     <br>
     to home position (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
     <br>
     Now they are back to swing as they did to star the dance
     <br>
     The swing is done in 8 counts.
     <br>
     <br>
     This is the complete figure, everyone is active at all times and now comes the stealing part (The MacGregor Steal).
     <br>
     The people who are not in the square can get in by stealing a position. A gent or a lady can steal in or they can steal in as a couple. Stealing can only be done when one of the dancing couples is returning to home position to swing. If a lady is stealing one of the dancing lady's partner, she will stop in front of the active lady and swing with her partner and this cuts the other lady out who then is free to steal right back in, or steal any other lady's position. This also goes for the gent. If a couple is stealing in, they stand in back of the couple that is going forward and back. As soon as this couple leaves their position to split their corners, the stealing couple steps into their position and starts to swing. When the active returns to position they find a couple in their place and they have been cut out.
     <br>
     <br>
     There are no calls for this dance. It is usually danced after the evening of square dancing is over. It is a very good outlet for those who have extra energy, and you will have a ball with it.
