<P CLASS="hdr">*Slaunchwise is done by couples facing couples in a straight line or in two circles around the hall, one couple facing wall, other couple facing center of hall. Turn your corner with a left hand round, then swing your partner, face couple to the left of you in opposite line or circle, do a right & left thru with this couple, (if done from two lines this will leave end couple in each line without anything to do for 8 beats of music, if done in a circle then everyone works), then do a right & left thru straight across with the couple facing you, chain the ladies across and back, then star with this couple in a right hand star, then back with a left hand star, then start over with the allemande left, etc. Couples will move up and down the lines or around the circle as dance progresses.</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
