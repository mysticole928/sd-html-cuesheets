<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Late one night, I heard a knock on my door, <br>
No surprise, it was my landlord. <br>
Notified me I was late with the rent.<br> 
What can you do when your last dollar's spent, <br>
 <br>
I called up my baby for a little advice, <br>
'Cos my sugar baby always treats me so nice. <br>
I had a funny feelin' that he wasn't alone, <br>
I heard another voice whisper: "Hang up the 'phone."<br>
Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind, <br>
There's always lots of trouble for me to find, <br>
I got Trouble trouble. Some kind of trouble. <br>

"To work on this poor broken heart of mine." <br>
He said: "I'd like to help you, I been there before. <br>
"The problem is, you don't work here no more. <br>
 <br>
I was down around as low as a body can be, <br>
So I talked to my preacher about prayin' for me. <br>
He smiled and he said: "Child, you're not alone. <br>
"'Cos all God's children got to deal with their own,<br>
