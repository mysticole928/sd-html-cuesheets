<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE (4 times through)</P><br><br>Now 1 & 3 go to the right and circle 4, don't take all night<br>
You make a line, go up and back with you<br>
Bend the line and square thru you count 4 hands and when you're through<br>
You pull 'em by and swing the corner Sue<br>
Left allemande but only one, you walk on by the girl you swung<br>
And swing the next little lady high and low, (heads get ready to go)<br>
1 & 3 (2 & 4) go up and back, pass thru, u-turn back<br>
Star thru and do the right & left thru<br>
Dive thru and star thru and pass thru<br>
Around just one, the line goes up and back, too<br>
Pass thru, bend the line, forward up and back in time<br>
Star thru, centers pass thru, left allemande<br>
You pass your own and wink your eye, swing the next I'll tell you why<br>
Just promenade this lady, two by two<br>
Just take this lovin' lady home and tell her that she's yours alone<br>
