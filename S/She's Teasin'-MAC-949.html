Left square thru just 4 hands round you go<br>
Turn your partners left, an allemande thar<br>
You back up boys, a right hand star<br>
Throw in the clutch, hey, pass that gal you know<br>
Allemande left your corners, promenade your own<br>
Promenade around that ring you two<br>

Break right out, 2 lines of 4<br>
It's forward eight and back to place and then<br>
You pass thru, fold the line*<br>
Star thru, bend the line<br>
