<BR>
Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">I know I'd stand in line until you think you have the time to spend and evening with me<BR>
And if we go someplace to dance I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me<BR>
</SPAN>Allemande and Weave<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">And afterwards we'd drop into a quiet little palce and have a drink or two</SPAN> <BR>
(Promenade) <SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><BR>
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like &quot;I love you&quot;</SPAN></P><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE (twice for heads, twice for sides)</P>

Head square thru four hands around and then you dosado<BR>
Swing thru, boys trade, boy run right, bend the line, <BR>
Boy walk - girl dodge, Hinge, fan the top, slide thru,<BR>
Swing your corner and all promenade<BR>

Four ladies chain turn the girl, rollaway and circle left<BR>
Four ladies rollaway circle left, allemande and weave<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">I can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before<BR>

<BR>
Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">I practice evry day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true<BR>
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late and I'm alone with you<BR>
</SPAN>Allemande and Weave<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red and oh the night's so blue</SPAN><BR>
