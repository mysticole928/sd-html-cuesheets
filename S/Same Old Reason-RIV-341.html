The heads [sides] make a Left Hand Star, you turn it 'round.<br>
To the corner make a Right Hand Star.<br>
Heads Star Left and roll it all the way back.<br>

Scoot Back, go boys, Scoot Back, go girls<br>
Star Thru and Promenade that old world<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well, I didn't want to listen to an owl in a tree<br>

So I had my family doctor come and visit with me<br>

I asked if he knew why I was sick and in bed<br>

He took one look and then he said, <br>

<br>

The doctor said the same as the owl did before<br>

So I thought I'd put the question to the girl next door<br>

She gave a big hug and a kiss to me<br>

She said, My darling,<br>
