<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - CLOSER</P><br><br>8 to the center for a rainbow stroll<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>When I was a child, down in South Caroline<br>
Soon as Saturday sun went on down<br>
My folks and sister would go and leave me home all alone<br>
Going to that big square dance</L></FONT><br>
Left allemande and weave<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well my old radio would play that old opery show<br>
So I never got lonesome or blue</L></FONT><br>
Promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>There ain't a thing in this world to make you fall in love, girl<br>
Like a San Antonio Stroll</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Now the heads promenade halfway with your maid<br>
Into the middle and square thru 4 hands around<br>
All the way around and then a right & left thru my friend<br>
Do an eight chain 6 across the town<br>
And then the lights went down low, the fiddler picked up his bow</L></FONT><br>
Swing that corner and you promenade her home<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Now I'll sing it to you so we both can do<br>
That old San Antonio Stroll</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>Circle left<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>When my folks would come home, they'd be hummin' a song<br>
Mama would smile and say child don't you know</L></FONT><br>
Allemande left to an allemande thar, go forward 2 and star<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Going to that big square dance in town</L></FONT><br>
Slip the clutch, pass 1 girl, left allemande the corner girl<br>
Dosado and you'll promenade her home</L></FONT><br>
