Heads Square Thru count 'em 4 hands round<br>
You make a Right Hand Star<br>
The Heads Star Left, roll it one time and then<br>
Same pair and do a Dosado<br>

Swing the corner lady round and Promenade<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">ADDITIONAL LYRICS</P><br><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>There are stars In the Southern sky Southward as you go <br>
There is moonlight And moss in the trees <br>
Down the Seven Bridges Road <br>
<br>
Now I have loved you like a baby Like some lonesome child <br>
And I have loved you in a tame way <br>
And I have loved you wild <br>
<br>
Sometimes there's a part of me That Has to turn from here and go <br>
Running like a child from these warm stars <br>
Down the Seven Bridges Road <br>
 <br>
There are stars in the Southern sky And if ever you decide <br>
You should go There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey <br>
Down the Seven Bridges Road<br>
