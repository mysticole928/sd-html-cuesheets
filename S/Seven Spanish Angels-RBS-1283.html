     She reached down and picked the gun up, that lay smoking in his hand
     <br/>
     Said father please forgive me, I can't make it without my man
     <br/>
     She knew the gun was empty, she knew she couldn't win
     <br/>
     But her final prayer was answered, when the rifle fired again
     <br/>
     There were seven Spanish angels at the the alter of the sun
     <br/>
     They were praying for the lovers in the valley of the gun
