Take a peek and trade the wave, and then you swing thru<br>
Boys trade and then you turn thru<br>

If you lift your hand to help someone</L></FONT><br>

You break 'em out in lines, move up and curlique<br>
Track & trade, and move right along, and when you get there now<br>
You tag the line and face in with a right & left thru<br>
You pass the ocean, then you swing thru<br>
Turn thru and swing her, promenade<br>

Boys run right, and swing that corner<br>
Left allemande and promenade<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You say there's no road that you'd care to travel<br>
Nothin' to say that ain't been said before<br>
And life's a mystery that you can't unravel<br>
Though love's the key that will open that door</L></FONT><br>
