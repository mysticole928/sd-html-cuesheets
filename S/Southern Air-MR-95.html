<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Yeah, ya all, there I was<br>
Just stepped on board flight 78492100...9765432...827652...7<br>
Flying non-stop from Hahira, Georgia to Yazoo City, Mississippi<br>
Done bought me one of them triple ultra-super saver center seat tickets<br>
Set down there between a duck and a ledbedder<br>
Fella tried to talk to me, couldn't understand a word he's saying<br>
Sounded like a log truck<br>
Duck didn't say nuthin'.<br>
All of a sudden, Captain Jerry Clower was comin' in on the inter-com<br>
Telling us to get ready for takeoff</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br><C>Head couples</C> <C>square thru 4</C> hands around you go<br>
Around the corner lady, <C>dosado</C> one time you know<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br><C>Sides face</C>, <C>grand sweep</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Yeah, ya all, there I was<br>
Must have been 500 feet over them pine trees<br>
Duck had done fainted on takeoff<br>
Had his little head laying on my arm there<br>
His little tongue just all hangin' out<br>
Then I heard this sharp ringing in my ears..."Howdy!"<br>
Why, it was Miss Pearl, handing out kneehighs, moon pies and bowls of butter beans<br>
Often wondered what she did on her off times<br>
She instructed us the no-chewing sign had been turned off<br>
And she would be our steward-us for the duration of the flight<br>
Duck didn't really seem to care, he was still out of it.</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">CLOSER</P><br><br><C>Sides face</C>, <C>grand sweep</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Yeah, ya all, there I was<br>
That Miss Pearl was giving me more attention she did that first class passenger<br>
Kept showing me all the new safety tips, playing with my seat belt<br>
Got me so nervous dropped my last piece of pecan pie right on that duck's head<br>
That little fellow came to, jumped up a quackin' and a squawkin'<br>
Didn't know where he was, started runnin' up and down the aisles<br>
Tripped over the ice cream freezer, stepped in the sweet potato pie<br>
Flew out the screen door and was gone!  Nothing but feathers.<br>
Then I heard Captain Clower again coming in on the inter-com<br>
Telling us he could see Yazoon City from here<br>
But there would be a short delay in landing<br>
'Till they could get the town windows cleaned.<br>
Seemed some crazy duck had come screaming through there<br>
And left the awfulest mess they ever did see.<br>
Well, that's their lines.</L></FONT><br>
