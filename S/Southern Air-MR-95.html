     Yeah, ya all, there I was
     <br/>
     Just stepped on board flight 78492100...9765432...827652...7
     <br/>
     Flying non-stop from Hahira, Georgia to Yazoo City, Mississippi
     <br/>
     Done bought me one of them triple ultra-super saver center seat tickets
     <br/>
     Set down there between a duck and a Leadbetter
     <br/>
     Fella tried to talk to me, couldn't understand a word he's saying
     <br/>
     Sounded like a log truck
     <br/>
     Duck didn't say nuthin'.
     <br/>
     All of a sudden, Captain Jerry Clower was comin' in on the inter-com
     <br/>
     Telling us to get ready for takeoff

     Yeah, ya all, there I was
     <br/>
     Must have been 500 feet over them pine trees
     <br/>
     Duck had done fainted on takeoff
     <br/>
     Had his little head laying on my arm there
     <br/>
     His little tongue just all hangin' out
     <br/>
     Then I heard this sharp ringing in my ears..."Howdy!"
     <br/>
     Why, it was Miss Pearl, handing out Nehi's, moon pies and bowls of butter beans
     <br/>
     Often wondered what she did on her off times
     <br/>
     She instructed us the no-chewing sign had been turned off
     <br/>
     And she would be our steward-us for the duration of the flight
     <br/>
     Duck didn't really seem to care, he was still out of it.

     Yeah, ya all, there I was
     <br/>
     That Miss Pearl was giving me more attention she did that first class passenger
     <br/>
     Kept showing me all the new safety tips, playing with my seat belt
     <br/>
     Got me so nervous dropped my last piece of pecan pie right on that duck's head
     <br/>
     That little fellow came to, jumped up a quackin' and a squawkin'
     <br/>
     Didn't know where he was, started runnin' up and down the aisles
     <br/>
     Tripped over the ice cream freezer, stepped in the sweet potato pie
     <br/>
     Flew out the screen door and was gone!  Nothing but feathers.
     <br/>
     Then I heard Captain Clower again coming in on the inter-com
     <br/>
     Telling us he could see Yazoo City from here
     <br/>
     But there would be a short delay in landing
     <br/>
     'Till they could get the town windows cleaned.
     <br/>
     Seemed some crazy duck had come screaming through there
     <br/>
     And left the awfulest mess they ever did see.
     <br/>
     Well, that's their lines.
