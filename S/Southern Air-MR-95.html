      <br>
      Flying non-stop from Hahira, Georgia to Yazoo City, Mississippi
      <br>
      Done bought me one of them triple ultra-super saver center seat tickets
      <br>
      Set down there between a duck and a Leadbetter
      <br>
      Fella tried to talk to me, couldn't understand a word he's saying
      <br>
      Sounded like a log truck
      <br>
      Duck didn't say nuthin'.
      <br>
      All of a sudden, Captain Jerry Clower was comin' in on the inter-com

      Telling us to get ready for takeoff

      Yeah, ya all, there I was
      <br>
      Must have been 500 feet over them pine trees
      <br>
      Duck had done fainted on takeoff
      <br>
      Had his little head laying on my arm there
      <br>
      His little tongue just all hangin' out
      <br>
      Then I heard this sharp ringing in my ears..."Howdy!"
      <br>
      Why, it was Miss Pearl, handing out Nehi's, moon pies and bowls of butter beans
      <br>
      Often wondered what she did on her off times
      <br>
      She instructed us the no-chewing sign had been turned off
      <br>
      And she would be our steward-us for the duration of the flight
      <br>
      Duck didn't really seem to care, he was still out of it.

      Yeah, ya all, there I was
      <br>
      That Miss Pearl was giving me more attention she did that first class passenger
      <br>
      Kept showing me all the new safety tips, playing with my seat belt
      <br>
      Got me so nervous dropped my last piece of pecan pie right on that duck's head
      <br>
      That little fellow came to, jumped up a quackin' and a squawkin'
      <br>
      Didn't know where he was, started runnin' up and down the aisles
      <br>
      Tripped over the ice cream freezer, stepped in the sweet potato pie
      <br>
      Flew out the screen door and was gone!  Nothing but feathers.
      <br>
      Then I heard Captain Clower again coming in on the inter-com
      <br>
      Telling us he could see Yazoo City from here
      <br>
      But there would be a short delay in landing
      <br>
      'Till they could get the town windows cleaned.
      <br>
      Seemed some crazy duck had come screaming through there
      <br>
      And left the awfulest mess they ever did see.
      <br>
      Well, that's their lines.

     (Grand Sweep: Sides part is the first 8 steps of a grand square, dosado, star thru
