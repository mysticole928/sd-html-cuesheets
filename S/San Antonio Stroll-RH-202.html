<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>When I was a child down in old San Antone<br>
When that Saturday sun would go down<br>
My folks and sister would go and leave me here all alone<br>
They'd go to that square dance in town<br>
My old radio would play that old opry show<br>
So I'd never be lonesome or blue<br>
Now I'll sing it for you just so we both can do<br>
That old San Antonio Stroll</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head 2 couples square thru and get about 4 hands around you do<br>
Make a right hand star and roll it around you go<br>
Heads star left around that ring, once around to the same sweet thing<br>
Dosado the corner you know, curlique<br>
Scoot back, boys run, boys fold, swing & promenade<br>

When my folks'd come home, they'd be humming a song<br>
They'd say now child don't you know<br>
There ain't a thing in this world<br>
That'll make you fall in love girl, like the San Antonio Stroll</L></FONT><br>
