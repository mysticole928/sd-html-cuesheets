Well now the four ladies chain and you turn 'em<br>

Roll away and circle go round, roll away again circle and then<br>

Allemande the corner and you weave around again<br>

I know that someday you'll want me to want you<br>

Swing your girl around and you promenade<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Thought you don't want me now<br>

</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I'll get along some how<br>

</L></FONT><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>And then i won't want you<br>

The heads two you square thru go four now<br>

Around the corner do a do ci di<br>

Swing thru and then the boy trade again<br>

Run around the corner girl then half tag the line<br>

You walk and dodge then chase to the right<br>

Swing the girl you're chasing promenade<br>
