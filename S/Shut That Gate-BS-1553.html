It resembles a California Twirl if done by couples. In this dance the line of 4 is facing out and all join hands. The center couple makes an arch in the middle (inside gent and inside lady) and while the left hand couple walks forward and around the right hand couple (with the outside lady in the lead) ducks under the arch and pulls the line straight to face back into the ring facing the opposite line.</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
