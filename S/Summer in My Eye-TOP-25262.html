<P CLASS="hdr">Tea Party Promenade: use same as grand square.  Takes 32 beats.  From a squared up position, on call to Tea Party Promenade the head ladies chain 3/4 while everybody else promenades to the right 1/4 (sides as a couple, the head men alone).  Sides upon reaching the head position wheel around 3/4 right face to face in and chain their ladies 3/4.  Head men courtesy turn their original partners at the side position and roll promenade 1/4 to the right to the head position across from home, they then wheel around 3/4 right face to face in and chain their ladies 3/4 etc.  Meanwhile the side couples (at the head position) have put their ladies in for a 3/4 chain, everybody else promenades 1/4 to the right.  The side men courtesty turn their original partners at the side position across from home and roll promenade, etc.  This continuous action is repeated until all are at home.  Each couple works with their original partner only throughout.</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
