<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>Allemande left go allemande thar, go forward two and make a star<br>
Men back in and make a right hand star<br>
Shoot that star, go full around, men star right across that town<br>
Allemande left, then weave around that ring<br>
Go in and out around that ring and when you meet that maid<br>
Take her hand and promenade, take her home and sing<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Sweet temptation, that's what they call this girl</L></FONT><br>
You take her home and swing and whirl<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1 & 3 lead to the right, circle 4 and make a line<br>
Without a stop you do a dosado, make an ocean wave and rock up and back<br>
Right & left thru across that track<br>
Cross trail back and swing that corner girl<br>
4 little ladies promenade go once around that ring<br>
Box the gnat then promenade, take her home and sing<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Sweet temptation, that's what they call this girl</L></FONT><br>
You take her home and swing and whirl<br>
