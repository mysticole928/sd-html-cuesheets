<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*The red headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana<br>
Rode into town one day<br>
And under his knees was a raging black stallion<br>
And loping behind was the bay</L></FONT><br>
<C>Circle left</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Don't cross him, don't boss him, he's wild in sorrow</L></FONT><br>
<C>Allemande left</C>, <C>swing</C> and <C>promenade</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Don't fight him, don't slight him, just wait till tomorrow<br>
And maybe he'll ride on again</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*A yellow haired woman leaned out of her window<br>
Watched as he passed her way<br>
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion<br>
And then cast greedy eyes on the bay</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr"><L>*But how could she know that the dancing bay pony</P><br><br>For that was the horse that his little lost darling<br>
Had ridden when she was his wife</L></FONT><br>
