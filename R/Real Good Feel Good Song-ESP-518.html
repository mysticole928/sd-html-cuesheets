<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - CLOSER</P><br><br><C>Sides face, grand square</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Did you ever wake up in the morning, nothing was going right<br>
Spent the whole night fussing and fighting with your wife<br>
Bills out in the mailbox you know that you can't pay<br>
Then you try to leave for work and your car's been hauled away</L></FONT><br>
<C>Four ladies promenade</C>, go <C>once around</C> the ring<br>
Get back home, <C>swing</C> your man and <C>promenade</C> I sing<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>One that makes you move your feet and want to sing along<br>
You need a real good, feel good song</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br><C>Heads promenade, go halfway</C> round the ring<br>
Walk in and <C>square thru four</C> hands around I sing<br>
Go all the way around, <C>touch 1/4</C><br>
<C>Follow your neighbor</C> <C>and spread</C>, <C>girls trade</C><br>
<C>Recycle</C>, <C>pass thru</C>, <C>trade by</C><br>
<C>Swing your corner</C> lady and <C>promenade</C> that guy<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>One that makes you move your feet and want to sing along<br>
You need a real good, feel good song</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*A friend of mine was workin' hard, saving all his pay<br>
Like Jesse James the IRS stole most of it away<br>
Then he got chased by a street gang and finally found a phone<br>
He called up the police and they put him on hold</L></FONT><br>
