<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>Join hands and circle around the ring you go<br>
Walk around the corner, see saw around your own<br>
Now men star by the right hand, go once around the land<br>
Allemande with the corner gal, gonna weave around the ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Rock and roll I gave you all the best years of my life</L></FONT><br>
Swing the lady round and round, you promenade tonight<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I was busy on the road a singin' love songs to you<br>
You were changin' your direction and you never even knew</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads promenade and go half around with you<br>
Star thru then everybody double pass thru<br>
You cloverleaf and now the centers do the right & left thru<br>
Turn the girl and square thru 3/4 round you do<br>
Allemande left the corner, walk right by just one<br>
Swing the next around and round and promenade her home<br>
