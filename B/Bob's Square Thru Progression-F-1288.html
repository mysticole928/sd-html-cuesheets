<P CLASS="hdr">---</P><br><br>Folkraft record number 1288 is the third in a series of American Progressive Grand Circle dances. This one is distinguished by the unusual rhythmic pattern of the "Square Thru" progression. The music B2, accurately fits the step pattern.<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">Proceed to do the "square thru" as usual, giving left hand to the opposite. Take two steps to get to your opposite, and in place three tiny steps in this rhythm. Slow, slow, quick, quick, quick. This is the step used all around the square thru movement, which is followed by "pull on by to an allemande left", which gives you a new partner.</P><br><br>The basic "step, step, one, two, three" is sometimes called the "cha-cha" step, in which case you might introduce it as "step, step, and a cha-cha-cha". It's lots of fun.<br>
