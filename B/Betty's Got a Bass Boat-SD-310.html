<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Now, Betty was your average ordinary girl<br>
Who never wanted very much outta this world<br>
Just an occasional dinner and twirl from a regular man</L></FONT><br>
<C>Allemande left</C> and <C>weave</C><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>So Betty stayed up one lonely night<br>
Tryin' to figure out what a man might like<br>
Then like a bolt right outta the blue<br>
She got herself a plan!</L></FONT><br>

She's thinkin' 'bout marketing a recipe<br>
It's so ironic and the funny thing is<br>
She never even liked to fish</L></FONT><br>

She's the most popular girl in town<br>
Since she got a new camper and a huntin' hound<br>

Oh but things sure got a lot better<br>
