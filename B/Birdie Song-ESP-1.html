With your hands in a waving "bye bye" position, pretend they're your birdie's beaks and "cheep", (closing hand touching fingers to thumb) three times<br><br>


With your arms in "wing" position, (thumbs under or near your arm pits, elbows extended) flap your "wings" three times<br>

Bend your kneed and wiggle your birdie's tail feathers three times<br><br>


Clap your hands three times to the beat of the music<br>

Repeat above sequence three times<br><br>


Make a right hand star and turn it eight steps, reverse with a left hand star eight steps. Repeat this twice then go back to top of figure.
