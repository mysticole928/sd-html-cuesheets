     *In 1814 we took a little trip
     <br/>
     Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississipp'
     <br/>
     We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
     <br/>
     And we fought the bloody British in the town of New Orleans
     <br/>
     We fired our guns and the British kept a-coming
     <br/>
     There wasn't nigh as many as there was awhile ago
     <br/>
     We fired once more and they began a-running

     *We looked down the river and we saw the British come
     <br/>
     There must have been a hundred beatin' on the drums
     <br/>
     They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
     <br/>
     We stood beside the cotton bales and didn't say a thing
     <br/>
     We fired our guns and the British kept a-coming
     <br/>
     There wasn't quite as many as there was awhile ago

     We fired once more and they began a-running

     *We fired our cannon until the barrel melted down
     <br/>
     So we grabbed an alligator and fought another round
     <br/>
     We filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind
     <br/>
     And when we set the powder off, the 'gator lost his mind
     <br/>
     We fired our guns and the British kept a-coming
