      <span class="lyrics">Well the cows went dry, the hens don’t lay, there’s no place I can borrow,<br>
      Give the landlord all the news and the rent comes due tomorrow,</span><br>
      Boys Star Right once inside, keep it,<br>
      Allemande your corner girl and Weave around the keep it.<br>
      <span class="lyrics">Lots of money in the bank, they say that’s where they keep it.</span><br>
      Swing that girl pretty little doll and Promenade, take it.<br>
      <span class="lyrics">So pick away on the old banjo; keep that guitar strumming.<br>
      Put more water in the soup; there’s better times a-coming.</span>

    <h2>Break Lyrics</h2>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Well Mary Lou could pull a plow, if only I would let her.<br>
      Twice as strong as any ox, and she don’t smell much better.<br>
      ...<br>
      I didn’t kiss that Mary Lou but once, and then I had to leave her .
    </p>
    <h2>Closer Lyrics</h2>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Well a man came by the other day, a-huntin’ manual labor.<br>
      I told him I hadn’t seen the guy, why don’t he ask the neighbor.<br>
      ...<br>
      So come on boys get your gals, and kick your heels up higher.

    <h1>FIGURE</h1>
    <p>
      Heads (Sides) Box the Gnat and then you Slide Thru.<br>
      Slide Thru once again, Reverse your Flutter Wheel.<br>
      Dixie Style to a wave, Balance in and out.<br>
      Boys Trade, Everybody Hinge and Walk and Dodge.<br>
      Wheel Around the girl you found, all Slide Thru.<br>
      Swing that girl, pretty little doll and Promenade, take it.<br>
      <span class="lyrics">So pick away on the old banjo; keep that guitar strumming.<br>
      Put more water in the soup; there’s better times a-coming.</span>
