<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Hey rock and roll music sure has got a beat<br>
When you hear that rhythm it brings you to your feet</L></FONT><br>
Those <C>men star by the right</C> in the middle and roll it round tonight<br>
And an <C>allemande</C> with the corner girl and <C>weave</C> that old ring<br>
Come on and wind it in and out, meet a girl go<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Well, baby likes to square dance but man she don't go<br>
For that boogie woogie music called rock and roll</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br><C>Heads</C> <C>square thru</C> and you gotta get 4 and go<br>
And around that corner do a <C>dosado</C><br>
<C>Swing thru</C>, <C>boys run right</C>, you <C>bend the line</C> tonight<br>
Now the ladies lead, <C>dixie style</C>, <C>explode and</C> clap your hands<br>
Do an <C>allemande left</C> that corner, <C>promenade</C> her round that ring<br>
