hundred reindeer came<br>

<span style="background-color: #FCC9C3">When they hitched him to the harness, he 
assumed a sprinter´s stance<br>
He knew this one trial run would be his only chance<br>
He tore across tall treetops with Donner by his side<br>
But when it all came crashing down</span>Allemande left &amp; Weave<br>
<span style="background-color: #FCC9C3">Cause he rear-ended Prancer and Dancer 
got it too<br>
When they pulled Santa from the pile, he was black and blue<br>
Mrs Clause said because Brad they lost the sleigh<br>
And now he´s where the has-beens and the never-wuzzes stay<br>

<span style="background-color: #FCC9C3">While he was out to pasture, his friend 
Comet came to call<br>
He said &quot;Be glad me good friend Brad, you,ve missed nothing at all&quot;<br>
&quot;I thought I´d see the forest, oceans and the mountain ranges&quot;<br>
Unless your name is Rudolph, the scenary never changes&quot;</span></p>
