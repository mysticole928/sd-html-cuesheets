      <span class="lyrics">Diamonds on the windshield, as Heaven starts to cry<br>
      In his rear-view mirror, his angel waves goodbye<br>
      She knows he's gotta go &mdash; she knows he's one of them<br>
      Brothers of the highway, children of the wind</span><br>
      4 Ladies Promenade, one time go 'round<br>
      Swing your girl, boys, and Promenade, go down<br>
      <span class="lyrics">That Detroit Diesel pirate ship is rollin' out again<br>

      4 Ladies Chain, hey, turn 'em with an arm around<br>
      Rollaway and then, circle around<br>
      Roll her Away and Circle the ring<br>
      Allemande that corner gal and Weave around the ring<br>
      <span class="lyrics">Another shot of truck stop coffee runnin' through his veins</span><br>
      Do Sa Do and Promenade 'er go 'round again<br>
      <span class="lyrics">Sailin' for the settin' sun, freedom's your best friend<br>
      Brothers of the highway, children of the wind</span>

      Heads Square Thru, 4 hands around you do<br>
      Out to the corner girl, Do Sa Do<Br>
      Swing thru now, don't stop, Spin The Top<br>
      Boy move up, Square Thru 3/4 Pop<br>
      When you're all facing out, Chase Right<br>
      Swing corner girl around, Promenade tonight<br>
