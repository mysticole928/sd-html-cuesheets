Circle to the left<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">* Changes will come and go, I've had my share I know</SPAN><BR>
Why don't the men star right once around<BR>
Do an allemande the corner,and weave on around<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">It was burgers and fries and Cherry pies</SPAN><BR>
Swing your girl around and promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Walking in the sand, hand in hand</SPAN> <BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Thinkin' this may never end</SPAN><BR>

<BR>
Heads promenade halfway, walk in and square thru I say<BR>
Four hands around and make a right hand star, go halway round<BR>
As a couple veer left, and the couples circulate<BR>
You half tag, trade and roll to face<BR>
Swing the same girl around and promenade<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Walking in the sand, hand in hand<BR>
In a world we used to know<BR>
</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">* I'm still the same old me, I guess I'll always be</SPAN>
