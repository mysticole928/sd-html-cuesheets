<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She'd go to the stockyards with her head held high<br>
A wigglin and twistin as the boys walked by<br>
Every time Sally went down to the pen<br>
She'd start a stampede - not the cattle, but the men</L></FONT><br>

<C>Chain 'em on back</C> and <C>promenade</C> the land<br>
