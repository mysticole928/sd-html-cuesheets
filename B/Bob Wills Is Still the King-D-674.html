<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Well the honky tonks in Texas were my natural second home<br>
Where you tip your hat to the ladies and the rose of San Antone<br>
Well I grew up on music that we called western swing<br>
It don't matter who's in Austin, Bob Wills is still the king</L></FONT><br>
<C>4 little ladies promenade</C> go inside of the ring<br>
Get back home and <C>swing</C> your man, then <C>promenade</C> I sing<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>**When you cross that old Red River that just don't mean a thing<br>
Cause once you're down in Texas, Bob Wills is still the king</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Well the <C>head two couples</C> <C>square thru 4</C> hands around and then<br>
You'll <C>make a right hand star</C> and <C>turn it once</C> my friend<br>
<C>Heads star left</C> <C>go one time</C>, to the same old two<br>
Go <C>right & left thru</C> and turn them with a <C>1/2 sashay</C> you do<br>
You <C>turn thru</C> and get a new corner, go <C>left allemande</C><br>
You come back one and <C>swing</C> and whirl then <C>promenade</C> the land<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>It's the home of Willie Nelson, the home of western swing<br>
He'll be the first to tell you, Bob Wills is still the king</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Well I can still remember the way things were back then<br>
In spite of all the hard times, I'd live it all again<br>
To hear the Texas Playboys and Tommy Duncan sing<br>
Makes me proud to be from Texas where Bob Wills is still the king<br>
<P CLASS="hdr">**When you cross that old Red River that just don't mean a thing</P><br><br><P CLASS="hdr">*If you ain't never been there then I guess you ain't been told</P><br><br>You can hear the Grand Old Opry from Nashville, Tennessee<br>
It's the home of country music, on that we all agree<br>
