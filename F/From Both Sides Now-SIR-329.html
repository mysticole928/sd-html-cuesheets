<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>
You circle left<br> 

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
*Bows and flows and angel hair<br> 
And ice cream castles in the air
</L></FONT><br> 
The men star right it's one time from there<br> 
Left allemande, weave the ring<br> 
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
Well I've looked at clouds from both sides now
</L></FONT><br> 
You swing with your girl you promenade somehow<br> 
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
It's cloud illusions I recall<br> 
I really don't know clouds at all
</L></FONT><br> 


<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>
Heads square thru and you get 4 hands go<br> 
Your corner lady, dosado<br> 
Swing thru and the boys you trade<br> 
Boys run right and bend your line<br> 
Square thru 3 hands round and swing<br> 
Your corner girl you promenade the ring<br> 
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
It's cloud illusions I recall<br> 
I really don't know clouds at all</L></FONT><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>
*Moons and Junes and ferris wheels<br> 
The dizzy dancin' way you feel<br> 
... It's love's illusions I recall<br> 
... I really don't know love at all<br><br> 

*Tears and fears and feeling proud<br>
Say "I love you" right out loud<br> 
... It's life's illusions I recall<br> 
... I really don't know life at all<br><br>
