Well those 4 ladies chain, get across that old ring<br>
Star 'em home, turn 'em left a dopaso<br>
Turn corner by the right, turn your partner by the left<br>
Head ladies center and a teacup chain and go<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>As he kicks off his shoes for the six o'clock news<br>
She's gettin' all prettied up<br>
While she's wanting to boogie, he wants to lay there<br>
She's got the Friday night blues</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads promenade and travel halfway around<br>
Walk in and square thru 4 hands in time<br>

You veer to the left and circulate one time<br>
