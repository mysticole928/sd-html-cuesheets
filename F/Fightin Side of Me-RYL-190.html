I hear people talkin' bad,<br>
About the way we have to live here in this country, <br>
Harpin' on the wars we fight,  <br>
An' gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be. <br>
An' I don't mind 'em switchin' sides,  <br>
An' standin' up for things they believe in. <br>
When they're runnin' down my country, man, <br>
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me. <br>
Yeah, walkin' on the fightin' side of me.<br>
 <br>
I read about some squirrely guy, <br>
Who claims, he just don't believe in fightin'. <br>
An' I wonder just how long, <br>
The rest of us can count on bein' free. <br>
If you don't love it, leave it: Let this song I'm singin' be a warnin'. <br>
They love our milk an' honey, but they preach about some other way of livin'. <br>
