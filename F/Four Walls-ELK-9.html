Out where the bright lights are glowing<br>
You're drawn like a moth to a flame<br>
You laugh while the wine's over-flowing<br>
While I sit and whisper your name<br>
<br>
Four walls to hear me<br>
Four walls to see<br>
Four walls too near me<br>
Closing in on me<br>
<br>
Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting<br>
But my walls have nothing to say<br>
I'm made for love, not for waiting<br>
But here where you've left me, I'll stay<br>
<br>
Four walls to hear me<br>
Four walls to see<br>
Four walls too near me<br>
Closing in on me<br>
<br>
One night with you is like heaven<br>
And so, while I'm walking the floor<br>
I'll listen for steps in the hallway<br>
And wait for your knock on my door<br>
<br>
Four walls to hear me<br>
Four walls to see<br>
Four walls too near me<br>
Closing in on me<br>
<br>
Closing in on me
