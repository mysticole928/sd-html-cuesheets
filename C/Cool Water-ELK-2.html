All day I've faced a barren waste<br><br>Cool water (water)<br>

Old Dan and I with throats burned dry<br>

And souls that cry for water (water)<br>

Cool (water), clear (water), water (water)<br>

CHORUS<br><br>*Keep a-movin' Dan, don't ya listen to 'em Dan<br>

He's a devil not a man and he spreads the burnin' sand<br>

With water (water)<br>

Dan can you see that big green tree<br>

Where the water's runnin' free<br>

And it's waitin' there for me and you?<br>

The nights are cool and I'm a fool<br><br>Cool water (water)<br>

But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn<br>

And carry on to water<br>

Cool (water), clear (water), water (water)<br>

The shadows sway and seem to say<br><br>Cool water (water)<br>

And way up there He'll hear our prayer<br>

And show us where there's water<br>

Cool (water), clear (water), water (water)<br>

Dan's feet are sore he's yearning for<br><br>Cool water (water)<br>

Like me I guess he'd like to rest<br>

Where there's no quest for water<br>

Cool (water), clear (water), water (water)<br>

<Cool, clear water (cool, clear water)
