<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Allemande that corner girl, come home and swing<br>
Then join hands and circle round the ring<br>
All 4 men step in, star by the right around the land<br>
Turn it to that corner, allemande, weave the ring<br>
Go winding and weaving around the ring you go<br>
Dosado that lady fair, then promenade from there<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>I thought I saw a teardrop in your eye<br>
But you don't have to be a baby to cry</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Head 2 couples promenade halfway around<br>
Lead to the right, make a right hand star go round<br>
Heads star left in the middle across to the opposite go<br>
With a dosado in time, then circle 4, heads break and make a line<br>
Go forward 8 and back with you, right & left thru, turn the girl<br>
Now cross trail, swing the corner, promenade the world<br>
