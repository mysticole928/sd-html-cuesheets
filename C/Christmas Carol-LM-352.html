     I was playing Santa Claus downtown on Christmas Eve
     <br/>
     When a little girl of 3 or 4 climbed up on my knee
     <br/>
     I saw she had a question behind those eyes of blue
     <br/>
     So I asked her what her name was

     She said my name is Christmas Carol, I was born on Christmas day

     I don't know who my daddy is and mamma's gone away

     All I want for Christmas is someone to take me home

     Early that next morning I got up and dialed the phone
     <br/>
     I made a few arrangements with the County Childrens Home
