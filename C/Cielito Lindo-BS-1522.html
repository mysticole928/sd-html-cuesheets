<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER</P><br><br>Bow to your little taw, sashay round your corners all<br>
And you swing twice around with your partner<br>
The gents star left go around that square<br>
And then you'll right hand turn your own (full turn)<br>
Now those girls star left around that old square<br>
And you right hand turn your partner (full turn)<br>
Allemande corners all, dosado around your taw<br>
And you weave around that old ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Ah, yi, yi, yi</L></FONT>, dosado Delores<br>
Now you'll take her and swing, promenade that ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Promenade your own senoras</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>1st and 3rd to the right, circle four to a line<br>
Go forward up and back with your lady<br>
Do a right & left thru, turn around and pass thru<br>
Turn to the left single file round the ring<br>
Those gents turn back, twice around that old track<br>
And you right hand turn your partner<br>
Allemande the corners all, dosado with your taw<br>
And you weave around that old ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Ah, yi, yi, yi</L></FONT>, dosado Delores<br>
With that corner you'll swing, promenade that ring<br>
