Join hands and circle to the left around you roam<br>
You circle left around then left allemande<br>
Now weave the ring around till you meet again<br>
When you meet you dosado one time around<br>
Left allemande and then you promenade on down<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You're crying on my shoulder for somebody else<br>
And my heart is crying for you</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Why those head two you pass thru, separate go round two<br>
Make a line go forward up and back<br>
Now star thru, then center two square thru 3/4 round<br>
Centers in and cast off 3/4 round that town<br>
Slide thru, then center two square thru 3/4, too<br>
You'll swing that corner and she'll promenade with you<br>
