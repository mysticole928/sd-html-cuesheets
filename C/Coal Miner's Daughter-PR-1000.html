   There is a young lady named Shari Brabham who is singing the words to the original song on both the called side and on the instrumental, through the whole music, so the calling is being done over her singing. On the called side, Al Horn is just giving the calls. He is letting the singing do the fill-in. It is dedicated to Ms. Shari Brabham: "Sheri was born in Columbus, OH Aug. 6, '64 being diagnosed for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at age one and has had 20 operations for joint fusions. Also blind in one eye with partial vision in the other. She was named Little Miss Arthritis in '74 and named the recipient of the Jerry Walsh Courage Award in 1980 and inducted in the Nat'l Honor Society as a senior, Sheri was the first handicap in the Jr-Hi choir and joined the Y.E.S. (wheelchair square dancers) in '80. Sheri sings at many area, state and nat'l square dance functions including the Nationals in Louisville, KY in 1983 and Detroit in 1982. Also the Ohio and W.VA. State Conv's, Danceathons, Telethons for Easter Seals, Oglebayfest and many more too numerous to mention. Sheri performs with the YES wheelchair group also being a dancer in her electric wheelchair. The YES group of handicapped young people range from 16-22 years. The group's reason for existence and purpose is two-fold: The most important is that these young people by their dedicated effort in learning to square dance have proven themselves Handicapable. They deserve the chance to demonstrate in front of large groups of people that they are not useless and to be pitied, but happy and capable. By their tremendous efforts, they are able to encourage other handicapped people to participate in recreational and social activities. This group of beautiful people are currently working to raise $10,000 to enable them to continue performing under the dedicated and capable hands of the YES group leaders and caller, Pam &amp; Jim Cooper, 4856 Brewster Dr., Columbus, OH 43227 of whom we give a big, big thanks for everything they have done!
