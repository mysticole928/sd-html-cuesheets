     *From the goodlands came the cowgirl, Patti was her name
     <br/>
     She was hot on the trail of that killer on a moped she called Flame
     <br/>
     'Cause the killer had killed her daddy just for spittin' in the road
     <br/>
     And you only had to kill her daddy once to get that gal p.o.'d

    <span class="songLyrics">
     *The killer took a step toward Patti, said, "It's time I gunned you down"
     <br/>
     But he slipped in something that was laying in the street and was shot before he hit the ground
     <br/>
     Yes, the killer slipped, it cost him his life, Patti said, as she raced out of town
     <br/>
     "You got to watch your step, when you know the chips are down."
