      He was as big as a tree and did what he pleased and everything he did was bad

      *From the goodlands came the cowgirl, Patti was her name
      <br>
      She was hot on the trail of that killer on a moped she called Flame
      <br>
      'Cause the killer had killed her daddy just for spittin' in the road
      <br>
      And you only had to kill her daddy once to get that gal p.o.'d
     </span>
     <br>
     <br>
     <span class="lyrics">
      *The killer took a step toward Patti, said, "It's time I gunned you down"
      <br>
      But he slipped in something that was laying in the street and was shot before he hit the ground
      <br>
      Yes, the killer slipped, it cost him his life, Patti said, as she raced out of town
      <br>
      "You got to watch your step, when you know the chips are down."
