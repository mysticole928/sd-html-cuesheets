Come along; I got something you should see<br>
It ain't rocket science; it ain't brain surgery<br>
If I can do it, you can do it, so come along with me!<br>
See these folks; they've known it all along<br>
See these folks; they can keep it goin'<br>
All your friends are here, you don't need to be alone<br>
(But) if you don't like it fast and loud you'd better stay at home!</L></FONT><br>
