<P CLASS="hdr">*On the call "get ready for the heel and toe" partners assume semi-closed (open ballroom) position and face the center of the square. Men start with left foot and lady with right foot and all do a heel and toe and then one two-step to the center. Each then faces out from the center (still in semi-closed position) and do a heel and toe and a two-step out. This is repeated in and out and then partners promenade.</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
