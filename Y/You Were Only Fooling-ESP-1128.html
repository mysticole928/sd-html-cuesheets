One & Three (Sides) Promenade go halfway<br>

Into the middle, Pass the Ocean there, Extend!<br>

Recycle then, Sweep a Quarter friend,<br>

Pass thru, Bend the Line, Right and Left thru<br>

Slide Thru, Pass Thru, Left allemande<br>

Back to the corner lady, Promenade<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>

All 4 Ladies Chain about three quarters<br>

Roll away, Circle go round<br>

Walk all around the Corner, See Saw your girl<br>

Allemande left and Weave that old world<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You lied to me with kisses, I tried to stop dreaming of.<br>
