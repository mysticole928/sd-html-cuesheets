Heads you promenade halfway now<BR>
Do the right and left thru and take 'em home<BR>
Square thru and count all four now<BR>
Then make a right hand star and go<BR>
Heads star left in the middle and turn it<BR>
All the way 'round go<BR>
Swing your corner and promenade her<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">But you were always on my mind<BR>
You were always on my mind

Hey now those four ladies chain go<BR>
Then roll away and circle left<BR>
Hey roll away and now you circle<BR>
Left allemande and weave the ring<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Oh little things we should have said and done</SPAN><BR>
Dosado and promenade her<BR>

You were always on my mind</SPAN></P>
