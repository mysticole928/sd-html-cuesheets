<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Circle left<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You're in love with the wrong man, holding the wrong hand<br>
Kissing the wrong lips, so hopelessly</L></FONT><br>
Left allemande that corner, dosado your own<br>
4 girls promenade, go movin' around the ring<br>
Turn the partner by the right, left allemande tonight<br>
Swing that lady, promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You're in love with the wrong man, he don't love you like I do<br>
And I'd trade him for me if I were you</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Those heads square thru there, 4 hands around that ring you go<br>
Split that pair around one and make your line<br>
Do a curlique, boys run around that girl and then<br>
Single circle to an ocean wave, boys run right<br>
You bend the line, square thru 3/4 round the ring<br>
Swing that corner, promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You're in love with the wrong man, he don't love you like I do<br>
And I'd trade him for me if I were you</L></FONT><br>
