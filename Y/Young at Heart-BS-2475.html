Four ladies chain cross the ring, you turn 'em and then<BR>
You chain her back and Promenade her my friend<BR>

The Heads star thru, you pass thru and then<BR>
Go right and left thru my friend - Veer to the left<BR>
As couples circulate and then, a Half Tag again<BR>
A walk and dodge you know - A partner trade<BR>
Reverse flutter wheel the sweep a quarter more<BR>
You veer to the right and promenade round the floor<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><L>Cause here is the best part, you've got a head start<BR>
