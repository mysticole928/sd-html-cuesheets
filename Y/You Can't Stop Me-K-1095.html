<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>4 ladies promenade inside that old ring<br>
Box the gnat and give that man a swing<br>
Put the ladies center back-to-back, men promenade the outside track<br>
Go full around and do a dopaso<br>
Turn partner left, corner by the right, partner left hand swing<br>
Roll promenade around that ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You can drop me, but you can't stop me<br>
From holding you, I'll swing you tonight</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Well 4 ladies chain the ring, turn the girl while I sing<br>
Join hands, circle left you go<br>
Do an allemande left like a daisy chain, go forward two with a right & left<br>
Turn back one, turn the corner right hand round<br>
Go forward two with a left and right, box the gnat and pull her by<br>
Swing that corner, promenade<br>
