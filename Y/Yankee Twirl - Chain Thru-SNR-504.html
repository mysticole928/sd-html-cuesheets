   Yankee Twirl: With two men facing across from each other join Left hands and pull by. Gents then join Right hands to the ladies Left hand, he makes an arch, and the ladies make a Left Face turn under the arch to end standing by the gents Right side and both are facing out, or back-to-back with their original partner. The moment the gents leave their position to join Left hands, the ladies should take one step sideways to their Left to stand in the same position the man has just vacated. The change accomplishes the same thing as "Heads ladies chain, heads pass thru". If the call is for all four couples to work or for all four gents to work together, they make a Left hand star in the center and go across the set and do the same thing as is described above.

Chain Thru: This is a new and useful figure used to change the ladies and eliminate an awkward courtesy turn at the end of the chain. Ladies designated will touch right hands and cross to the opposite gent, passing right shoulder to right should with each other, of course (as in ladies chain). With Right hands the gents take ladies Left hand and turns her under his right, a Left Face turn for the ladies, and she is standing by his right side and both are facing into the center of the set. Same as in a ladies chain except that there is no courtesy turn at the end. If the call is for All Four Ladies to do a Chain Thru, the ladies make a right hand star and go across the set and do the same thing as described above.
