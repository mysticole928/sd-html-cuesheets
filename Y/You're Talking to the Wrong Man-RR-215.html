Sides face grand square<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Hey daddy, I’ve got a problem.<BR>
Last night I took my girlfriend for a ride.<BR>
And the way she held my hand dad.<BR>
I got this funny feeling down inside </SPAN><BR>
Allemande and weave <BR>
<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">Son you're talking to the wrong man</SPAN><BR>
Swing your girl around and Promenade<BR>

<BR><BR>
Heads you square thru, four hands around now<BR>
And with the sides make a right hand star<BR>
Heads star left now, one time around there<BR>
To that corner do a dosado<BR>
You're gonna swing thru, boys you trade now<BR>
Swing that corner girl around and promenade<BR>

<SPAN CLASS="lyrics">By the way son, I’ve got a problem.<BR>
 I wonder if you’d talk with me a while.<BR>
 See lately, mama she ignores me.<BR>
 Hardly ever gives me a little smile </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="lyrics"><BR>
So I guess we’ll, just go fishing.<BR>
Maybe head out for the old golf course today.<BR>
And if our buddies, ask us about women.<BR>
Think I know exactly what we’ll say </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="lyrics">If you want to know what’s girl are all about<BR>
You’re talkin, to the wrong men.<BR>
We still ain’t got them women figured out</SPAN>
