<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You can't judge a book by its cover<br>
You can't tell dear if it's good or bad<br>
The book may be in the brightest color<br>
But inside the story may be sad</L></FONT><br>
Allemande left and weave<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Though the pages may be stained with pain</L></FONT><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads square thru 4 hands you go now all the way<br>
And do a right & left thru, turn this girl<br>
Swing thru and then boys run right<br>
Do a 1/2 tag, swing thru tonight<br>
Centers trade, boys run right, square thru 3/4<br>
Swing the corner and promenade<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Just because you see somebody smiling<br>
Doesn't mean inside there is no pain<br>
So it doesn't matter what you hear, dear<br>
Don't believe until you know it's true</L></FONT><br>
