<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*It's not so much the things you say to me<br>

It's not the things you do<br>

It's how I feel each time you're close to me<br>

That keeps me close to you<br>

You are the (wo)man that I've always dreamed of<br>

I knew it from the start<br>

I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart</L></FONT><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads promenade half way around the ring you go now<br>

Lead right, circle four and make a line<br>

Go forward up and back, you pass the ocean, Jack<br>

Boys circulate, those girls trade in time<br>

Swing thru you do and boys run right, now tag the line all the way<br>

Face Left, promenade back to where you start<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">ALTERNATE LYRICS</P><br><br><FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*It's not so much your pretty face I see<br>

It's not the clothes you wear<br>

It's more the way you look at me<br>

That always keeps me there<br>

You are the (wo)man that I've always dreamed of<br>

I knew it from the start<br>

I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart<br><br>

*It's hard to tell you all the love I'm feeling<br>You've got a way to send my senses reeling<br>

Everytime you smile<br>

You are the (wo)man that I've always dreamed of<br>

I knew it from the start<br>

I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart</L></FONT><br>
