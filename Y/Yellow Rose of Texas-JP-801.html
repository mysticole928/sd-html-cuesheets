<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>There's a yellow rose in Texas, I'm going home to see<br>
No other fellow loves her, half as much as me</L></FONT><br>
Men star right, one time around left allemande that corner<br>
Turn your partner right, all four ladies promenade<br>
In the middle of the ring you go, star thru with your partner<br>
And you promenade home<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You can talk about your Clementine, and dream of Rosalie<br>
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me</L></FONT><br><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>(Heads twice, sides twice)<br>
Heads promenade half around<br>
Half way you go, down the middle and touch a quarter<br>
Do a walk and dodge, you pass thru and trade by<br>
Do a right and left thru, then veer to the left<br>
And couples circulate one time you do, tag the line<br>
The girls go left the boys go right and swing<br>
Swing that lady and promenade the ring<br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She's the sweetest little rose bud, that Texas ever knew<br>
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew</L></FONT><br>

<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>She cried so when I left her it almost broke my heart<br>
And if we ever meet again, we never more shall part</L></FONT><br><br>
