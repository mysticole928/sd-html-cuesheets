<P CLASS="hdr">OPENER - MIDDLE BREAK - CLOSER</P><br><br>4 ladies chain across you know<br>
You roll away, circle left and go<br>
4 ladies roll away, circle awhile<br>
Allemande that corner girl and weave<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You don't have to say you love me, just be close at hand<br>
You don't have to stay forever, I will understand<br>
Believe me, I can't help but love you<br>
But believe me, I'll never tie you down</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads you promenade half way you know<br>
Down the middle and pass the ocean, extend the tag<br>
Swing thru and then, spin the top for me<br>
Move up and do the right & left thru with a half sashay<br>
Left square thru, on number 4<br>
You swing that corner girl and promenade the floor<br>
