<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO - MIDDLE BREAK - ENDING</P><br><br>Allemande left, go allemande thar, right & left and make a star<br>
Men back up, make a right hand star for me<br>
Shoot that star go full around, turn that corner right hand round<br>
Men star left once around that ring for me<br>
Same girl you box the gnat, then you're gonna swing<br>
Allemande left that corner girl, come back and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Pretty clothes and fancy car, you're not the cat you think you are<br>
No you can't, no you can't have my love</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Side 2 ladies chain across, turn her round and don't get lost<br>
4 little ladies chain across that ring you go<br>
Heads go forward back with you, dosado across from you<br>
Make an ocean wave, rock it up and back you do<br>
Swing thru go two by two, rock up and back again<br>
Box the gnat and cross trail, that corner girl you swing<br>
Promenade go round that world, take her home and tell that girl<br>
