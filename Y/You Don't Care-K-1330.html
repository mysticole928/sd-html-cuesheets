<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO</P><br><br>

Well all 4 ladies chain you turn them left<br>
Then chain the lady right back home again<br>
Join up all of your hands, circle left around that town<br>
Left allemande and weave the ring<br>
Wind in and out around until you meet your girl<br>
Dosado and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics">Darlin' I love you so it's kind of hard to know<br>
That you don't care what happens to me</FONT><br><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE #1</P><br><br>

Heads pass the ocean and all 4 boys extend<br>
All recycle, now all veer to the left, the center ladies trade<br>
You 4 tag the line, face left and now swing thru in time<br>
Boys you trade, turn thru you go<br>
Swing the corner girl and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics">Darlin' I love you so it's kind of hard to know<br>
That you don't care what happens to me</FONT><br><br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE #2</P><br><br>

Heads touch 1/4 and let the boys run right<br>
Right &amp; left thru and turn your girl<br>
Half sashay, swing thru, and now ladies trade<br>
Those ladies run, ferris wheel, swing thru in the middle<br>
Everybody scoot back, swing the corner girl and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics">Darlin' I love you so it's kind of hard to know<br>
That you don't care what happens to me</FONT><br>
