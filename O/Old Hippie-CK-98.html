<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*He turned 35 last Sunday<br>
In his hair he found some grey<br>
But he still ain't changed his lifestyle<br>
He likes it better the old way</L></FONT><br>

And get four hands around the ring you go, <C>dosado</C><br>

And <C>ferris wheel</C>, <C>centers</C> <C>pass thru</C><br>
<C>Slide thru</C> and <C>square thru 3/4</C> more<br>
<C>Swing</C> that corner girl and <C>promenade</C> that floor<br>
