     Now I've been calling ten years or so and I've listened to a lot of tales of woe
     <br>
     And I weighed each one and tried to do what's best
     <br>
     I'm always glad lend an ear, I've got something for you to hear
     <br>
     I've just got to get it off my chest
     <br>
     <br>
     I think square dancin' is for fun and brother I'm a son-of-a-gun
     <br>
     If I can figure old Buster out to save my life
     <br>
     He wants a real rat race, tug and jerk, it just ain't safe the way he works
     <br>
     I've taken out insurance on my life
     <br>
     <br>
     He wants a dixie daisy, split square thru, divide the clutch with a Suzy Q
     <br>
     Double cross trail, reverse wrap around
     <br>
     Just killin' 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looks up out of breath, said
     <br>
     Son, when you gonna let that hammer down?
     <br>
     <br>
     Well, I called a dance in West Palm Beach to a high level group out of my reach
     <br>
     I called the first tip feelin' out the floor
     <br>
     Then old Buster walked up, I knew he would, said son I'll tell you for your own good
     <br>
     This group likes hash at a 154
     <br>
     <br>
     Well, I called 'em fast and I called 'em long, but down inside I felt all wrong
     <br>
     I'd much rather call a smoother dance that flows
     <br>
     But I revved the speed up all the way and I figured they're the ones who paid
     <br>
     So I closed my eyes and said to myself, here goes!
     <br>
     <br>
     I called an all 8 chain, an eight chain thru, pair off 8, and a grand chain 2
     <br>
     A dixie twirl, and a wrong way wheel around
     <br>
     Just killin' 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looks up out of breath, said
     <br>
     Son, when you gonna let that hammer down?
     <br>
     <br>
     Well, I called a dance in Arkansas, I said get your partner, get your taw
     <br>
     I want to walk you through a brand new call
     <br>
     Old Buster looks up with his tongue in his cheek, said that's new? we did it last week
     <br>
     You travelin' callers best get on the ball
     <br>
     <br>
     Well, he goofed the set from A to Z and he tried to put the blame on me
     <br>
     And that's the place I should have called his hand
     <br>
     He didn't do the dance too well, but you could hear old Buster yell
     <br>
     Each time he heard me call left allemande
     <br>
     <br>
     He wants to pair it, bend it, shuffle and stack, cross twirl out, and u-turn back
     <br>
     To an alamo cast off, once and a half around
     <br>
     Just killin' 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looks up out of breath, said
     <br>
     That's it son, let that hammer down
