<P CLASS="hdr">*A Dixie Twirl is done from any even-numbered line of 4 or more people.  It resembles a California Twirl if done by couples.  In this dance the line of 4 is facing out and all join hands.  The center couple makes an arch in the middle (inside gent and inside lady) and while the left hand couple walks forward and around, the right hand couple (with the outside lady in the lead) ducks under the arch and pulls the line straight to face back into the ring facing the opposite line.</P><br><br>**A Dixie Wheel is done by any two couples facing one another.  In this dance, couples (which are "out of order") in two lines of 4 facing one another.  Each lady is going to do a Dixie Chain but adds a full turn and 1/2 in the center before the finish of her Dixie Chain.  Each lady gives her right hands to the opposite, lady goes once and a 1/2 around to the opposite man and giving him her left hand pulls him by and continues to face out and wait for the next call.  Each man being pulled into the center gives a right hand to the man coming toward him and each pulls the other by to end up behind the lady he was following.  Lady then turns left, man right ready for the left allemande with original corners.<br>
