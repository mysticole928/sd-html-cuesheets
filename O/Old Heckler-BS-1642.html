     Well I ain't too big, tall or fat, born an Okie and I can't help that
     <span class="call">
     </span>
     <br>
     A travelin' caller as most of you folks know
     <br>
     I make my livin' bookin' dates, callin' square dances around the states
     <br>
     And there isn't any place that I won't go
     <br>
     <br>
     That's north, south, east or west, I always try to do my best
     <br>
     To call 'em smooth and keep 'em dancing 'round
     <br>
     But old Buster's there to pester me from Oregon east to Tennessee
     <br>
     From Canada way south to Alabam'
     <br>
     <br>
     Well I called a dance in Iowa, drove through ice and snow all day
     <br>
     A great big dance, say 50 sets or more
     <br>
     Old Buster walked up slim and tall, said son you ought'a hear me call
     <br>
     It doesn't take me long to stop the floor
     <br>
     <br>
     Well I've been calling ten years or so and I've heard a lot of tales and woe
     <br>
     And I weighed each one and tried to do what's best
     <br>
     You know I'll always lend an ear, I've got something for you to hear
     <br>
     I've just got to get it off my chest
     <br>
     <br>
     Now, I think square dancin' is for fun and brother I'm a son-of-a-gun
     <br>
     If I can figure old Buster out to save my life
     <br>
     He wants a real rat race with a tug and a jerk, it isn't safe the way he works
     <br>
     I've taken out insurance all my life
     <br>
     <br>
     He wants a dixie daisy, split square thru, divide the clutch with a Suzy Q
     <br>
     Double cross trail, reverse wrap around
     <br>
     Just killed 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looked up out of breath, said
     <br>
     Son, when you gonna let that hammer down
     <br>
     <br>
     Well, I called a dance in West Palm Beach, a high level group way out of my reach
     <br>
     I called the first tip feelin' out the floor
     <br>
     Old Buster walked up, I knew he would, said son for your own good
     <br>
     This group likes hash at a 154
     <br>
     <br>
     Well, I called 'em fast and I called 'em long, but down inside I knew I was wrong
     <br>
     I'd rather call a smoother dance that flows
     <br>
     So I revved the speed up all the way and I figured they're the ones to pay
     <br>
     So I closed my eyes and said to myself, here goes!
     <br>
     <br>
     Call an all 8 chain, an eight chain thru, pair off 8, and a grand chain 2
     <br>
     A dixie twirl, a cross twirl, and u-turn back
     <br>
     Just killed 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looked up out of breath, said
     <br>
     Son, when you gonna let that hammer down
     <br>
     <br>
     Well, I called a dance in Arkansas, said get your partner, get your taw
     <br>
     I wanna walk you through a brand new dance
     <br>
     Old Buster looked up with his tongue in his cheek, said that's new? we did it last week
     <br>
     You travelin' callers better get on the ball
     <br>
     <br>
     Well, he goofed the set from A to Z and he tried to put the blame on me
     <br>
     And I guess that's the time I should have called his hand
     <br>
     He didn't do the dance too well, but you could hear old Buster yell
     <br>
     Each time he heard me call left allemande
     <br>
     <br>
     He wants to pair it, bend, shuffle the stack, cross twirl out, and u-turn back
     <br>
     Alamo cast off, once and a half around
     <br>
     Just killed 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looked up out of breath, said
     <br>
     Son, when you gonna let that hammer down
     <br>
     <br>
     He wants a dixie daisy, split square thru, divide the clutch with a Suzy Q
     <br>
     Double cross trail, reverse wrap around, don't slow down
     <br>
     He wants an all 8 chain, an eight chain thru, pair off 8, and a grand chain 2
     <br>
     A dixie twirl, a cross twirl, and u-turn back
     <br>
     <br>
     He wants to pair it, bend, shuffle the stack, cross twirl out, and u-turn back
     <br>
     Alamo cast off, once and a half around
     <br>
     Just killed 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looked up out of breath, said
     <br>
     That's it man, let that hammer down
     <br>
     <br>
     That's it man, let that hammer down
