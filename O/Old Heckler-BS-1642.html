<br><br>Well I ain't too big, tall or fat, born an Okie and I can't help that<br>

A travelin' caller as most of you folks know<br>

I make my livin' bookin' dates, callin' square dances around the states<br>

And there isn't any place that I won't go<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">That's north, south, east or west, I always try to do my best</P><br><br>But old Buster's there to pester me from Oregon east to Tennessee<br>

From Canada way south to Alabam'<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Well I called a dance in Iowa, drove through ice and snow all day</P><br><br>Old Buster walked up slim and tall, said son you ought'a hear me call<br>

It doesn't take me long to stop the floor<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Well I've been calling ten years or so and I've heard a lot of tales and woe</P><br><br>You know I'll always lend an ear, I've got something for you to hear<br>

I've just got to get it off my chest<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Now, I think square dancin' is for fun and brother I'm a son-of-a-gun</P><br><br>He wants a real rat race with a tug and a jerk, it isn't safe the way he works<br>

I've taken out insurance all my life<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">He wants a dixie daisy, split square thru, divide the clutch with a Suzy Q</P><br><br>Just killed 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looked up out of breath, said<br>

Son, when you gonna let that hammer down<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Well, I called a dance in West Palm Beach, a high level group way out of my reach</P><br><br>Old Buster walked up, I knew he would, said son for your own good<br>

This group likes hash at a 154<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Well, I called 'em fast and I called 'em long, but down inside I knew I was wrong</P><br><br>So I revved the speed up all the way and I figured they're the ones to pay<br>

So I closed my eyes and said to myself, here goes!<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Call an all 8 chain, an eight chain thru, pair off 8, and a grand chain 2</P><br><br>Just killed 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looked up out of breath, said<br>

Son, when you gonna let that hammer down<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Well, I called a dance in Arkansas, said get your partner, get your taw</P><br><br>Old Buster looked up with his tongue in his cheek, said that's new? we did it last week<br>

You travelin' callers better get on the ball<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">Well, he goofed the set from A to Z and he tried to put the blame on me</P><br><br>He didn't do the dance too well, but you could hear old Buster yell<br>

Each time he heard me call left allemande<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">He wants to pair it, bend, shuffle the stack, cross twirl out, and u-turn back</P><br><br>Just killed 'em off, run 'em to death, Buster looked up out of breath, said<br>
