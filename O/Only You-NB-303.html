It's like a story of love<br>
Can you hear me<br>
Came back only yesterday<br>
I'm moving further away<br>
Want you near me<br>
<br>
All I needed was the love you gave<br>
All I needed for another day<br>
And all I ever knew<br>
Only you<br>
<br>
Sometimes when I think of her name<br>
When it's only a game<br>
And I need you<br>
Listen to the words that you say<br>
It's getting harder to stay<br>
When I see you<br>
<br>
All I needed was the love you gave<br>
All I needed for another day<br>
And all I ever knew<br>
Only you<br>
<br>
This is going to take a long time<br>
And I wonder what's mine<br>
Can't take no more<br>
Wonder if you'll understand<br>
It's just the touch of your hand<br>
Behind a closed door<br>
<br>
All I needed was the love you gave<br>
All I needed for another day<br>
And all I ever knew<br>
Only you<br>
