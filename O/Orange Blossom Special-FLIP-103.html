   The figure used in this dance is taken from Run The Gauntlet by Dave Palmer Ypsilanti, Michigan. The break Weave the Ring Like a Daisy Chain is credited to an idea by Jim Hall Birmingham, Alabama. If you have difficulty with this just pretend you are touching hands and remember to go forward two, back one, as you do in the standard Daisy Chain.
