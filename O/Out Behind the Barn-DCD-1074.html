Four Ladies roll away, Circle Left and go<br>
Left Allemande and Weave The Ring<br>

Heads Square Thru count 'em 4 hands round<br>
You make a Right Hand Star<br>

Same pair and do a Dosado<br>

Swing the corner lady round and Promenade<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">ADDITIONAL LYRICS</P><br><br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>* I smoked my first cigarette, out behind the barn<br>  
** I got so sick, you should have seen how that tobacco turned me green<br>
I almost died of nicotine, out behind the barn<br><br>  
* I tasted my first moonshine, out behind the barn<br>  
** My face went red, my lips turned blue, I just had time to make the loo <br> 
I wish I’d tipped that awful brew, out behind the barn<br><br>
* My pappy used to tan my hide out behind the barn<br>  
** He’d lay me down across his knee, and then he’d put his strap to me<br>  
It sure did hurt my dignity out behind the barn<br><br>
* I wish that I could go again, out behind the barn<br>  
** Well you may think it ain’t no fun, to be a poor old farmer’s son<br>
But you don’t know the things I’ve done, out behind the barn<br><br>  
* I met a pretty girl one day, out behind the barn<br>  
** Well, she was scared, and I was too, but the things we figured out to do<br>
Boy they’d make your hair turn blue, out behind the barn<br>
