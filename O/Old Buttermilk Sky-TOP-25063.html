<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Dosado your corner, come home and swing with your girl<br>
Head couples square thru 4 hands in the middle you do<br>
With the outside 2, right & left thru, turn a girl and dive thru<br>
Square thru in the middle you two, sides divide, star thru<br>
Well a right & left thru, turn her too, dive thru and square thru<br>
Sides divide and star thru, find your corner swing<br>
You swing with that lady, round and round, left allemande<br>
Grand right & left, hand over hand<br>
With the one you know just do a little dosado<br>
Back to back and then promenade her home<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">MIDDLE BREAK</P><br><br>Dosado your corner, come home and swing with your girl<br>
Just promenade around that ring, single file, hear me sing<br>
Girls back track, two times around you go<br>
The second time you meet, box the gnat you know<br>
Pull her by, left allemande, go allemande thar<br>
Right & left, men back up, got a right hand star<br>
Shoot that star all the way round, corner you swing round and round<br>
Swing with that lady, left allemande<br>
You weave that ring, it's in and out you go<br>
When you meet your girl, do a little dosado<br>
You promenade<br>
