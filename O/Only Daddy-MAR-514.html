Well get back home and Swing, now everybody Swing<br>
Join hands and Circle Left, go movin' round you go<br>
Do an Allemande Left with the corner girl and Weave the ring you go<br>
Well wind it weave it in and out, meet a pretty little lady there<br>
Swing and whirl with the pretty little girl, Promenade the Square<br>
