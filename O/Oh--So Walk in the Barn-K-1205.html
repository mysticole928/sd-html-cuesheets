<P CLASS="hdr">(Note: when heads complete the pass the ocean and Oh So as they walk & dodge, have the girls dodge and take a step forward out as they dodge to give more working room for new heads.  If sides will take full 16 counts to do your part it works very, very well.  However, the sides sometimes get in a hurry.  Please don't.)</P><br><br></BODY></HTML>
