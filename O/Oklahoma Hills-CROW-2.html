<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>*Many months have come and gone<br>
Since I wandered from my home<br>
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born</L></FONT><br>
Left allemande your corner, gonna box the gnat at home<br>
Do a wrong way grand around the ring you roam<br>
Meet your partner, all 8 spin the top<br>
It's 1/2 by the right, 3/4 by the left<br>
Girls step up, swing and promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>Way down yonder in the Indian Nation<br>
A cowboy's life is my occupation<br>
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>Heads square thru 4 hands around you know<br>
And around your corner lady dosado<br>
Slide thru, pass thru, and partner trade<br>
Touch 1/4, coordinate around the ring you go<br>
Boys move up and bend your line and<br>
Cross trail thru, look for your corner<br>
Swing the girl and then you promenade<br>

I rode my pony on the reservation<br>
