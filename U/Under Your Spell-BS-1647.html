1 & 3 go up and back, pass thru now<br>
Travel round 1 you do, in that middle<br>
Square thru 3/4 round, left allemande and weave the ring<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You've got me under your spell again, and when we meet again</L></FONT><br>
Swing with me baby, promenade<br>
<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>You've got me dreaming those dreams again<br>
Scheming those schemes again<br>
I can't believe you're really mine</L></FONT><br>
<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE</P><br><br>4 ladies chain, you chain across that ring now<br>
Roll away, circle left around that ring now<br>
1 & 3 go up and back, 1/2 square thru across that track<br>
Swing that girl facing you and promenade<br>
Those head 2 you wheel around, cross trail across that town<br>
Swing with that corner, promenade<br>

Doing those things again<br>
I can't believe you're really mine</L></FONT><br>
