<P CLASS="hdr">INTRO</P><br><br>1 & 3 go forward up and come on back<br>
Pass thru and separate around just one,<br>
In the middle, square thru 3/4 round you want to go<br>
Left allemande, do a dosado<br>
All the ladies promenade inside the land<br>
Dosado and then you promenade that man<br>
Hold his hand and smile at him, I'll tell you why<br>

<P CLASS="hdr">FIGURE 1</P><br><br>All 4 ladies you can chain across the ring<br>
Now the heads will promenade go 1/2 around<br>
To the right and circle 4 and make a line<br>
When you're done go forward 8 and back<br>
And now you cross trail thru<br>
Allemande left (wait 2 beats)<br>
Weave the ring, it's in and out around you go (wait 5 beats)<br>
Dosado your own (wait 2 beats) now the boys star by the left<br>
And take it once around you go<br>
Dosado that girl and then your corner swing<br>
Go high and low and now you promenade again<br>
Hold her hand and smile at her, I'll tell you why<br>
