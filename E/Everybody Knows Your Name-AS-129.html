<h2>Opener</h2>
<p><strong>Side Face Grand Square</strong></p>
<p>Making your way in the world today<br />
Takes everything you've got<br />
Taking a break from all your worries<br />
Sure would help a lot<br />
Wouldn't you like to get away?<br />
Sometimes you want to go&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Allemande Left</strong> and <strong>Weave</strong></p>
<p>...where everybody knows your name.</p>
<p><strong>Swing</strong> and <strong>Promenade</strong> the lane</p>
<p>You want to go where people know,&nbsp;people are all the same.<br />
You want to go where everybody knows...</p>
<h2>Figure</h2>
<p>Heads <strong>Lead Right</strong><br />
<strong>Circle to a Line</strong><br />
<strong>Right &amp; Left Thru</strong><br />
<strong>Pass the Ocean</strong><br />
Girls <strong>Trade</strong><br />
<strong>Recycle</strong><br />
<strong>Square Thru 3</strong><br />
<strong>Swing</strong> Corner &amp; <strong>Promenade</strong></p>
<p>You want to go where people know people are all the same.<br />
You want to go where everybody knows...</p>
<h2>Middle Break</h2>
<p><strong>Sides Face Grand Square</strong></p>
<p>All those nights when you've got no lights<br />
the check is in the mail.<br />
Your little angel hung the cat up by its tail.<br />
Your third fiance didn't show.<br />
Sometimes you want to go&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Allemande Left</strong> and <strong>Weave</strong></p>
<p>...where everybody knows your name.</p>
<p><strong>Swing</strong> and <strong>Promenade</strong> the lane</p>
<p>You want to go where people know, people are all the same.<br />
You want to go where everybody knows...</p>
<h2>Closer</h2>
<p><strong>Sides Face Grand Square</strong></p>
<p>Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead<br />
the morning's looking bright.<br />
Your shrink ran off to Europe and didn't even write.<br />
Your husband wants to be a girl.<br />
Be glad there's one place in the world...</p>
<p><strong>Allemande Left</strong> and <strong>Weave</strong></p>
<p>...where everybody knows your name.</p>
<p><strong>Swing</strong> and <strong>Promenade</strong> the lane</p>
<p>You want to go where people know, people are all the same.<br />
You want to go where everybody knows your name.</p>
