<FONT CLASS="lyrics"><L>* You're a carousel, you're a wishing well, and you light me up, when you ring my bell, <br>You're a mystery, you're from outer space, you're every minute of my every day.
<br><br>
* And I can't believe, that I'm your man, And I get to kiss you baby just because I can, <br>Whatever comes our way, we'll see it through, And you know that's what our love can do.
